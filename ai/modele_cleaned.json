            "context": "MODULE I. CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nEU target: In 2021, the EU proposed climate neutrality, the goal of zero net emissions by \n2050, legally binding to the EU whole package of economic policies. It set an interim target \nof 55% emission reduction by 2030. This goal of zero net emissions is enshrined in the \nclimate law. The European Green deal (EGD) is the roadmap for the EU to become \nclimate-neutral by 2050.\n1.\tCLIMATE NEUTRALITY VERSUS CARBON NEUTRALITY\nClimate neutrality means to only emit as much greenhouse gas into the atmosphere as can \nbe absorbed by nature, that is forests, oceans and soil. To reach such a net-zero emissions \nbalance by 2050, EU countries will have to drastically reduce their greenhouse gas emissions \nand find ways of compensating for the remaining and unavoidable emissions.\nCarbon Neutrality and Climate Neutrality are often used interchangeably, but they are not the \nsame thing. So, a company can be considered carbon neutral when the amount of CO2 emissions \nemitted into the atmosphere is the same amount of CO2 that can be absorbed naturally by forests \nand plants (which function as carbon sinks thanks to photosynthesis) or that is compensated by \nother actions. In other words:\nGross CO2 Emissions Produced - CO2 Emissions Absorbed and/or Offset = 0\nAlthough it is a simple equation, getting to zero is a bit more complicated. First of all, one need \nto calculate what your Carbon Footprint is (it will be explained in a dedicated seminar). \nOnce you know what your Carbon Footprint is, one should reduce as much as possible the \nemissions produced as a result of economic activity, and on the other hand, compensate for those \nthat one has not been able to eliminate.\nTo reduce carbon emissions, the key is to change habits and invest in cleaner, more efficient \ntechnologies that consume less energy and produce fewer CO2. But, to be honest, depending on \nthe economic activity characteristics, one will not always be able to reduce the carbon emissions \nto the point where they are 100% absorbed by nature, or at least not immediately. So those CO2 \nemissions one has not been able to eliminate, it is to compensate for them in other ways, so that \nthe equation results in zero.\n \nFig. 1. Application: Zero waste biochar as a carbon-neutral tool for sustainable development\nTo compensate for carbon emissions NOT absorbed one can choose between different actions, \nsuch as:\n*\tCarbon capture and storage,\n*\tInvesting in synthetic fuel research,\n*\tSupporting projects to restore or preserving carbon sinks, such as investing in forest \nrestoration, wetlands, coastline, etc,\n*\tOr purchasing carbon credits. \nClimate Neutrality refers to the mitigation of all greenhouse gases (GHG), not just carbon \ndioxide.\nIn other words, a company will achieve climate neutrality when the amount of greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions it emits into the atmosphere is the same as the amount of greenhouse gases \n(GHG) that can be naturally absorbed by natural sinks (forests, seas, etc.), or that are offset by \nother actions.\nIn this case, the equation would be as follows:\n(Any) Gross GHG Emissions Produced - (Any) GHG Emissions Absorbed and/or Offset = \n0\nIt is true that carbon neutrality is a big step, as carbon dioxide accounts for about 80% of the \nplanet's greenhouse gases. But there are still 20% of other gases that need to be in balance in \norder not to affect global warming. We are referring to:\n*\tWater Vapor (H2O)\n*\tNitrous oxide (N2O)\n*\tMethane (CH4)\n*\tOzone (O3)\n*\tSome Halocarbons (such as CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs and PFCs)\nIn many cases, being carbon neutral will limit the contribution to climate change. However, any \ncompany' actions should not only focus on mitigating the CO2 emissions, but also on controlling \nand improving emissions of these other gases. \nIn some sectors, for example, they do not need to be carbon neutral to limit their contribution to \nglobal warming, as they release major amounts of GHGs (see the list above). One of the well-\nknown examples is the livestock sector, whose contribution to global warming is through \nmethane emissions produced by animals. \n2.\tEU POLITICS FOR CLIMATE NEUTRALITY\nThe European Council underlined that the transition to climate neutrality brings significant \nopportunities for:\n*\teconomic growth\n*\tmarkets and jobs\n*\ttechnological development\nFor the latest option, there is a market regulated by the European Union. It is like a kind of \nstock exchange, where the price per ton of carbon has been set, and where one can buy or sell \nthe needed tons of CO2 to meet the legal and carbon neutrality targets.\nThe EC also recognized the need to ensure that the green transition is cost-effective, as well as \nsocially balanced and fair. Leaders called on the European Commission to put forward \nproposals, so that countries can reach the 2030 goal, including by:\n*\timproving green finance standards\n*\tstrengthening the EU's emissions trading system\n*\tspurring climate-friendly innovation\n*\tensuring fairness and cost-effectiveness\nIn July 2021, the European climate law - a key element of the European Green Deal - entered \ninto force, one month after the Council had adopted it. EU countries are now legally obliged to \nreach both the 2030 and 2050 climate goals.\n \nFig. 2. The climate law sets the framework for action to be taken by the EU and the member \nstates to progressively reduce emissions and ultimately reach climate neutrality in the EU by \n2050.\nAlso in June 2021, the Council approved conclusions endorsing the new EU strategy on \nadaptation to climate change presented by the European Commission. The strategy outlines a \nlong-term vision for the EU to become by 2050 a climate-resilient society that is fully adapted \nto the unavoidable impacts of climate change.\nAnother key part of the EU's work towards climate neutrality is the 'Fit for 55' package. A set of \nproposals for revision of existing legislation and new initiatives, it is the EU's key plan for \nturning climate goals in accordance to EU law.\n\n \n\nFig. 3. 'Fit for 55' package actions\nThe package includes rules on:\n*\tenergy\n*\ttransport\n*\temissions trading and reductions\n*\tland use and forestry\nShifting to a greener way of life is crucial to address the climate emergency and reduce \ndependency on fossil fuels, especially those from Russia. The EU and its 27 countries are \nworking on new common rules under the Fit for 55 package to reduce the EU's carbon footprint.\nWhile emissions are rising in some sectors, such as international aviation and transport, other \nsectors have reduced their emissions enormously since 1990, with energy industries leading the \nway with a decrease of 47%. By 2020, the EU had already achieved a 30% reduction compared \nto 1990 levels.\nFinancing the EU's climate transition\nThe shift towards a climate-friendly economy will require major public and private \ninvestment.\nEU countries have committed to spending 30% of the EU's long-term budget for 2021-2027 and \nthe 'Next Generation EU' recovery instrument on climate-related projects.\nTo ensure that the climate transition is fair, the EU has introduced a just transition mechanism \nto provide financial and technical support to the regions most affected by the move towards a \nlow-carbon economy. Up to 90 billion is to be mobilized to this end.\n30% of all EU expenditure until 2027 will go to climate-related projects.\n\nShaping global action\nThe EU's efforts in fighting climate change are in line with the commitments made by the EU \nand the member states in the Paris Agreement, signed in 2015. EU countries support a high \nlevel of ambition in implementing this international agreement and encourage global partners, \nboth in international forums and in bilateral relations, to accelerate action to limit global \nwarming.\nThe EU, together with its member states, is the biggest provider of climate finance in the \nworld. The funds it provides support climate-related action in developing countries, to facilitate \ntheir green transition and tackle the adverse effects of climate change.\nA.\t2030 climate & energy framework' objectives\nThe 2030 climate and energy framework include EU-wide targets and policy objectives for the \nperiod from 2021 to 2030.\nThe 2030 Framework maintains the target structure of the EU's 2020 Package, which aims to cut \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent, increase the share of renewable energy in the EU's final \nenergy consumption to 20 percent and improve energy efficiency by 20 percent. Along the same \nlines, the 2030 Framework includes an at least 32 percent target for renewable energy and a \ntarget to enhance energy efficiency by at least 32.5 percent.\nGreenhouse gas emissions - raising the ambition\nIn July 2021, the European Commission adopted a set of proposals to make the EU's climate, \nenergy, transport and taxation policies fit for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least \n55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.\nThis will enable the EU to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.\nThe proposals refer to:\n1.\tEnergy efficiency\nReducing energy consumption and achieving energy savings is essential to deliver the European \nGreen Deal.\n2.\tRenewable energy\nEnergy from renewable sources reduces greenhouse gas emissions and lowers our dependence on \nimported fossil fuels.\n3.\tMarkets and consumers\nThe EU's integrated internal energy market helps to keep energy affordable and guarantee secure \nsupplies.\n4.\tEnergy strategy\nThe EU's strategy for secure, competitive, and sustainable energy.\n5.\tOil, gas and coal\nEnsuring the efficient and responsible use of fossil fuels.\n6.\tInfrastructure\nA modern energy infrastructure, connecting markets and regions, is crucial to meet EU's energy \nand climate goals.\n7.\tEnergy security\nThe EU works to ensure that energy supplies from abroad are secure and affordable.\n8.\tResearch and technology\nInnovation in low-carbon and clean energy technologies are essential to fulfil the EU's energy \nunion strategy.\n9.\tFunding and financing\nEU programs, calls for tenders and private-public initiatives to finance energy projects.\n10.\tInternational cooperation\nEU energy cooperation with countries around the world and international institutions.\n11.\tNuclear energy\nThe EU aims to ensure safe and secure use of civil nuclear energy, which generates almost 30% \nof its electricity.\n12.\tEnergy system integration\nOur energy systems need to be sufficiently flexible to facilitate cross-border, cross-sector \ninnovation and investment.\nB.\t3 main Legal Instruments in the 2030 Framework\nThe Governance Regulation is the 'major novelty element' in the 2030 Framework. Aligned with \nthe Paris Agreement, it covers three key areas: planning, reporting and monitoring.\nPlanning\nThe Governance Regulation requires Member States to prepare two plans, national energy and \nclimate plans (NECPs) and long-term strategies (LTSs). The Commission must prepare an LTS \nfor the EU as a whole.\nNECPs are a core element of the 2030 Framework. In the NECP, each Member State defines its \nnational contribution to the five Energy Union objectives, including the EU-level renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency targets. Member States are also required to specify their plans to \nreach these targets along with their national greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in sectors \noutside the ETS. NECPs are prepared every 10 years and updated at five-year intervals.\nReporting\nThe Governance Regulation also serves to comply with reporting obligations under the Paris \nAgreement and to track the implementation of the EU's energy efficiency, renewable energy and \nother Energy Union targets.\nStarting from 2023 and every two years thereafter, Member States must prepare integrated \nnational energy and climate progress reports (biennial progress reports). These cover all five \ndimensions of the Energy Union and describe progress in NECP implementation. In addition, \neach Member State must submit annual greenhouse gas inventory reports to the Commission and \nthe UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). Secretariat. The \nGovernance Regulation includes various provisions on national and Union-level data collection \nand reporting systems, as well as registries to account for the NDC (Nationally Determined \nContribution) and international carbon credits.\nMonitoring\nThe Governance Regulation creates a monitoring system to track the implementation of the 2030 \nFramework and the associated targets at the EU and Member State levels. The system relies on \nex ante and ex post monitoring by the Commission.\nPublic participation\nThe Governance Regulation requires that Member States establish a multilevel climate and \nenergy dialogue involving various stakeholders and the general public to discuss different \nscenarios for climate and energy policies. NECPs may also be considered during the dialogue.\nC.\tThe climate component of the 2030 Framework\nAs a whole it has put precise limits to greenhouse gas emissions and created a price for them in \nthe covered sectors, namely power generation, iron and steel, chemicals, oil refineries, cement \nand other building materials, as well as pulp and paper. In addition, the ETS applies to aviation \nemissions in the participating countries.\nD.\tThe energy component of the 2030 Framework\nOur focus is on the switch to an overall EU renewable energy target, national support schemes, \nself-consumers and renewable energy communities, renewables in heating and cooling as well as \nin transport, including biofuels (comprising bioliquids, biogas and biomass fuels).\nauthorizes Member States to apply renewable energy support schemes and requires that direct \nprice support schemes take the form of a market premium\nincludes provisions to promote renewable energy in sectors other than electricity, namely \ntransport as well as heating and cooling\n\n3.\tTECHNOLOGIES FOR ACHIEVING C-NEUTRALITY\nCarbon is one of the most important elements that contribute to the existence of life on Earth. \nSince the Industrial Revolution, C-based resources have been exploited to produce energy, food, \nand other commodities, affecting the global ecosystems in countless ways. The extensive use of \nfossil fuels and deforestation to promote anthropogenic activities and urbanization are entwined \nwith global climate change, which stems from the greenhouse effect associated with increased \natmospheric CO2 and other GHGs. Currently, the international community is confronted with \ndeveloping cost-effective and sustainable methods for minimizing C emissions and promoting C \nsequestration. As the global community is moving towards C neutrality, there is a need to revise \nour understanding of the current state of C flows in the total environment. Therefore, it has \nbecome imperative to switch from non-renewables to renewables that sustain current production \nsystems and address climate change issues to protect human health and the environment\nTo achieve C neutrality and sustainably support human activities, it is of utmost importance to \nreduce fossil fuel and food C emissions while promoting C sequestration in terrestrial and marine \necosystems.\n\nA.\tTechnologies for renewable energy production\n1.\tSolar energy\nAlthough their power conversion efficiencies have reached more than 18%, it is necessary to \nfurther improve the efficiency and stability of large-area solar cells and reduce the product \nmanufacturing and decarbonization costs. \nBesides photovoltaic and solar thermal technologies, some strategies to convert solar radiation \ninto stable chemical fuels also provide feasible ways for large-scale utilization and storage of \nsolar energy toward energy decarbonization. For instance, great efforts have been made on solar \nhydrogen production, demonstrating an extremely attractive route to produce hydrogen fuel by \nadopting renewable solar energy or solar-derived power to electrolyze water.\n\n \nFig. 4. Technologies for Carbon neutrality (F. Wang et al, Technologies &perspectives for \nachieving C-neutrality, The Innovation 2, 100180, November 28, 2021, 1-22)\n\n2.\tWind energy\nAlthough the wind resource on Earth is abundant, the uneven distribution of wind resources \nacross the landscape poses a challenge to the transport of electrical energy produced by wind \nturbines. And the unpredictable nature of winds in terms of speed and direction will result in a \nvariable and unstable phase, amplitude, and frequency for the generation of electricity, which \nmay make it difficult to be integrated into the grid.\n3.\tOcean Energy\nThe ocean energy reserve is enormous globally and is enough to power the entire world. \nTechnologies to harvest tidal and wave energy are on the verge of commercialization. \nTechnologies for harvesting ocean current energy, thermal energy, and osmotic energy are still in \ntheir early development stage\n4.\tBioenergy\nBiomass is a renewable source of energy that originates from plants. The most important sources \nof biomass are agricultural and forestry residues, biogenic materials in municipal solid waste, \nanimal waste, human sewage, and industrial wastes. Biomass provides 13%-14% of the annual \nglobal energy consumption. Various processes are used to convert biomass into energy, \nincluding the followings: a) Thermochemical conversion of biomass includes gasification, \npyrolysis, and combustion. b) Chemical conversion converts vegetable oils and animal fats into \nfatty acid esters through esterification or/and transesterification to produce biodiesel. c) \nBiochemical conversion converts biomass into liquid fuels (e.g., alcohols and alkanes), natural \ngas (e.g., hydrogen and methane), different types of bio-products.\nThe most common biomass feedstock used for biological conversion is lignocellulosic biomass, \nsuch as agricultural and forestry residues. Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant and \nwidely available renewable resource in the world, mainly composed of three heterogeneous \nbiopolymers.\n5.\tH2 energy\nHydrogen fuel cell technologies have developed rapidly and are ready for commercialization, to \nthe point that we now see commercial sales of hydrogen-powered passenger cars, and heavy-duty \nvehicles, trains, and ships. The main issue now is to reduce the cost while maintaining an \nacceptable level of durability and efficiency.\n6.\tNuclear energy\nNuclear energy is a major contributor to clean energy, accounting for 40% of low-C electricity \ngeneration worldwide, and avoids about 1.7 Gt CO2 emissions a year globally. Therefore, \nnuclear energy is a strategic approach to ensure national energy security and achieve C \nneutrality. Nuclear energy is mainly generated through nuclear fission, while nuclear fusion \ntechnology is at the R&D stage.\n7.\tGeothermal energy \nGeothermal energy is non-carbon-based heat energy contained in the interior of the Earth, with \nthe advantages of stability, continuity, and high capacity. It will play an important role in \nproviding a stable and continuous basic load in the future energy structure.\n8.\tEnergy storage\nThe electricity produced from most renewables is random and intermittent, which hinders the \nwidespread application of renewables. Therefore, developing energy storage technology is \npivotal to improving electricity output reliability and stability from renewables.\nDifferent energy storage technologies have different reliability, cost, efficiency, scale, and safety. \nThese technologies complement each other, and their applications are dependent on many \naspects, such as energy storage time, site requirements, and environmental concerns.\n \nFig. 5. Core technologies for renewable energy production (F. Wang et al, Technologies & \nperspectives for achieving C-neutrality, The Innovation 2, 100180, November 28, 2021, 1-22)\n\nB.\tTechnologies for enhanced carbon sink in global ecosystems\n\nGlobal ecosystems contribute to the release and capture of CO2, methane (CH4), and nitrous \noxide (N2O), and influence the atmospheric GHG composition and the climate. \n\n \nFig. 6. Systems for GHG reduction & absorption\n\nZero waste biochar is a carbon-neutral tool, very important to reduce solid waste. Driven by the \nextensive expansion of food, urban, and industrial systems, billions of tons of solid waste are \ngenerated globally every year.\nBiochar, a fairly new term but an ancient tool, is a porous solid material that is produced from \nthe treatment of feedstocks at high temperatures (3000C- 9000C) under limited oxygen or \noxygen-free conditions. The thermochemical decomposition of feedstocks into biochar can be \ncarried out by various methods, including pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, torrefaction, \ngasification, and traditional carbonization. Among these methods, pyrolysis is widely employed \nto produce biochar since it preserves one-third of the feedstocks as persistent biochar products \nwhile also generating biooils and non-condensable gases.\n\nC.\tTechnologies for CO2 capture, utilization, and storage\n\nThe CO2 capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology comprises three different \nprocesses: separating CO2 from emission sources, CO2 conversion and utilization, transportation, \nand storage underground with long term isolation from the atmosphere.\n\n \nFig. 7. The roadmap for CO2 capture technology development in the industry (F. Wang et al, \nTechnologies & perspectives for achieving C-neutrality, The Innovation 2, 100180, November \n28, 2021, 1-22)\n\nCO2 utilization\nThe CO2 chemical utilization refers to processes of converting CO2 into other high-value \nchemicals under certain conditions of temperature, pressure, and the presence of a catalyst. \nAlthough significant efforts have been made over the past several years, the conversion of CO2 \ninto fuels and chemicals is still challenging in overcoming both thermodynamic and kinetic \nbarriers.\nBecause we are already committed to some level of climate change, responding to climate \nchange involves a three-pronged approach: \n1.\tReducing emissions of and stabilizing the levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the \natmosphere (\"mitigation\");\n2.\tGeoengineering is the deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth's natural \nsystems to counteract climate change.\n3.\tAdapting to the climate change already in the pipeline (\"adaptation\").\n \nFig. 8. Conceptualizing climate change mitigation, geoengineering, and adaptation (Matos S. et \nal, Technovation 117 (2022) 102612, 1-17)\n\nHarnessing the power of renewable resources in energy, food, and industrial production systems \nand promoting C sequestration in terrestrial and marine ecosystems are seen as possible routes \ntowards C neutrality and achieving sustainable development goals. However, the current level of \nresearch has not overcome the major challenges to efficiently use renewable resources in \nproduction systems and prevent us from depending on fossil fuels. Many problems still require \nscientific, socio economical political, and technological solutions to adopt practices that reduce \nGHG emissions in current global production systems. These include:\n1. Given that the potential of global renewable energy resources surpasses global energy \ndemand, the most pressing research needs in sustainable development are enhancing the current \nrenewable energy production trend to phase out the use of fossil fuels. Increasing the amount of \npower and heat generated from C-free sources (i.e., sun, wind, and ocean) is one aspect of this, \nbut so is the production of biofuels and hydrogen from biomass. The intermittency of wind, solar \nand other renewable energy sources is one of the major challenges limiting the replacement of \nfossil fuels with renewable energy. Energy storage is the apparent answer to the intermittency of \nsome of the renewable energy sources. However, the scalability and cost-effectiveness of energy \nstorage are subject to many constraints and limitations. Energy storage development and \npromotion entail scientific and technological challenges, as well as economic and regulatory \nconcerns that must be addressed in order to drive investment and competition in the energy \nstorage industry. Improving energy efficiency (including residential heating/cooling) has a major \nimpact on reducing GHG emissions in our daily lives. Therefore, more research is needed to \nfully understand how to maximize energy efficiency and support C-neutral economic growth. As \nthere is a clear link between energy conservation and climate change mitigation, efforts to \nminimize energy consumption in end-use sectors will contribute to sustainable development as \nwell as carbon neutrality targets.\n2. Considering that unsustainable management practices in food systems, spanning from the \nproduction and application of chemical fertilizers to waste landfilling and burning, continue to \naccount for a significant portion of GHG emissions, more research is needed to reduce emissions \nfrom food systems and enhance sinks of C and other important nutrients (i.e., nitrogen, \npotassium, phosphorus, and sulfur). To achieve this, developing new methods for further \noptimization of waste recycling and nature-based processes in agroecosystems, along with the \ntechnological development of food factories, has the potential to reduce the need for chemical \nfertilizers and sustainably support human activities. Given that biochar has multifunctional \nvalues in addition to carbon sequestration, there is a need to integrate ecological strategies to \noptimize biochar production, characterization and life cycle analysis, and to formulate model-\nbased standards and experimental evidence to spur biochar-assisted sustainable development. \nSince terrestrial and marine ecosystems are the largest C reservoirs on Earth, strengthening \npolicies that promote afforestation and reforestation and use of C-negative materials to conserve \nterrestrial ecosystems and sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems could contribute to \nincreasing C sequestration, thereby mitigating climate change.\n3. Even though the CCUS (CO2 capture, utilization, and storage) approach has a pivotal role to \nplay in our pursuit of carbon neutrality, the adoption of current CCUS technologies is hampered \nby their high energy consumption and costs. Carbon capture and storage in the power industry \nrequire scientific and technological innovations to achieve low or even net-zero energy use. Poly \ngeneration, chemical looping combustion, and technologies that combine fossil fuels and \nrenewable energy sources for capturing CO2 could open a new era for CCUS. At the same time, \nthe conversion of CO2 to fuels and chemicals is also a promising possibility, but the obstacles of \nthermodynamics and kinetics need to be overcome.\n4. Given the utmost relevance of monitoring GHG emissions from space to ensure the world is \non track to meet its climate change mitigation goals, the accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution \nof monitoring GHG emissions from satellites need to be further strengthened so as to monitor \ngreenhouse gas emission sources and rates more comprehensively and timely. The capacity and \naccuracy of satellites in monitoring terrestrial ecosystem biomass also need to be improved. \nRemote sensing monitoring of marine carbon sink potential needs new theoretical breakthroughs. \nCarrying out accurate carbon budget calculation based on land-sea-air joint observation is an \nimportant basis for carbon peak and carbon neutralization decision-making."

            "context": "MODULE II. GREEN / SUSTAINABLE ENERGY\n\nEU target. There are two major objectives: (a) Increasing Energy Efficiency. (b) Replacing \nthe fossil fuels use to generate energy by green / sustainable sources of energy\nThe revised Energy Efficiency Directive (EU/2023/1791), published in the Official Journal on 20 \nSeptember 2023, significantly raises the EU's ambition on energy efficiency.\nIt establishes 'energy efficiency first' as a fundamental principle of EU energy policy, giving it \nlegal-standing for the first time. In practical terms, this means that energy efficiency must be \nconsidered by EU countries in all relevant policy and major investment decisions taken in the \nenergy and non-energy sectors.\nThe 2023 revision of the directive follows a proposal for a recast directive on energy efficiency \nput forward by the Commission in July 2021, as part of the EU Green Deal package. The 2021 \nproposal was further enhanced as part of the REPower EU plan, presented by the Commission.\nThe 2023 revised directive raises the EU energy efficiency target, making it binding for EU \ncountries to collectively ensure an additional 11.7% reduction in energy consumption by \n2030, compared to the 2020 reference scenario projections. As a result, overall EU energy \nconsumption by 2030 should not exceed 992.5 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) for primary \nenergy and 763 Mtoe for final energy.\nThe revised directive more than doubles the annual energy savings obligation (Article 8) by \n2028. This is one of the key policy instruments of the directive to meet the headline target and to \ndrive energy savings in end-use sectors, such as buildings, industry and transport.\nSupport to new high-efficiency cogeneration units using natural gas and connected to district \nheating in efficient district heating and cooling systems will only be possible until 2030, whereas \nany other fossil fuel use will be banned for new heat generation capacities in such systems. EU \ncountries will also have to promote local heating and cooling plans in large municipalities having \npopulations above 45 000.\nGREEN / SUSTAINABLE ENERGY: DEFINITIONS \nA sunburst chart is showing the share of different types of fuel in electricity generation in the \nEU: In 2022, 39.4% of electricity was generated from renewable energy sources, 38.7% \nfrom fossil fuels and 21.9% from nuclear power.\n \nFig. 1. Power production in the European Union 2020-2022, by fuel (Published by Statista \nResearch Department, Oct 17, 2023)\n\n \nFig. 2. The structure of renewable sources generating electricity in EU in 2020 (Source: Eurostat)\nPeople often use the terms \"sustainable\" and \"renewable\" interchangeably. However, there is a \ndifference between the two: the possibility of replenishment.\nSustainable energy, as highlighted above, is theoretically inexhaustible. It cannot be depleted \nbecause sustainable energy sources don't need to be replenished. For example, think of the sun \nor wind. Neither resource needs to be created or replaced.\nOn the other hand, renewable energy is theoretically exhaustible - it uses resources from \nthe earth that can naturally be replenished, such as crops and biomatter. A renewable \nenergy source like bioenergy uses biological masses (e.g. agricultural byproducts like straw and \nmanure) to create energy. Conversion of waste into value-added products such as energy \ntransforms a potential environmental problem into a sustainable solution. The topic Energy from \nWaste: Production and Storage focuses on the conversion of waste from various sources for use \nin energy production and storage applications. It provides the state-of-the-art in developing \nadvanced materials and chemicals for energy applications using wastes and discusses the various \ntreatment processes and technologies. \n*\tCovers synthesis of usable materials from various types of waste and their application in \nenergy production and storage.\n*\tPresents an overview and applications of wastes for green energy production and storage \n*\tProvides fundamentals of electrochemical behavior and understanding of energy devices \nsuch as fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, and solar cells.\n*\tElaborates on advanced technologies used to convert waste into green biochemical \nenergy\nIn the light of such considerations, converting food, agriculture or municipal waste to useful \nenergy is becoming a reasonable and economic topic. The opportunity of applying food waste as \na suitable feedstock to producing biofuels is in progress. The conversion of waste is achieved via \nbiological treatments involving composting, anaerobic digestion, and fermentation; there are also \nthermal or thermochemical technologies involving incineration, pyrolysis, gasification, plasma \ntreatment, and hydrothermal carbonization; transesterification; and bio electrochemical \ntreatments. \nSustainable energy includes any energy source that cannot be depleted and can remain \nviable forever. It does not need to be renewed or replenished; sustainable energy meets our \ndemand for energy without any risk of going bad or running out. This is why sustainable energy \nis the answer to our energy needs.\nFurthermore, sustainable energy doesn't harm the environment (or at most, there is a minimal \nrisk), increase climate change or cost a heavy price. Although there is a cost associated with \ncreating and building ways to capture sustainable energy, the energy sources themselves are \ntypically free.\nFossil fuels (e.g. coal, natural gas and oil) are not only harmful to the planet when burned daily \nfor energy, but they're also unsustainable as finite resources. Sustainability refers to the concept \nthat all people can meet their basic needs infinitely, without compromising future generations. \nSustainability in terms of energy embraces the same principles.\n\n \nFig. 3. Green energy is generated from infinite sources that do not produce carbon emissions or \nharm the environment. \nSustainable energy is generated from sources that replenish themselves faster than they are \ndepleted. Knowing the differences between the two aids in the fight against global climate \nchange. Green and sustainable energy sources are alternatives to fossil fuels (e.g., coal, oil, \nnatural gas) that aid in the fight against global climate change because they help curtail \nGHG emissions.\nBoth green and sustainable energy sources are in infinite supply, but only green energy sources \nhave the added benefit of not producing GHG emissions or negatively impacting the \nenvironment. \nBasically, all green energy is sustainable energy, but not all sustainable energy is green \nenergy. Green energy comes from sources that provide the highest environmental benefit, \nwhereas sustainable sources can be harvested indefinitely. \n \n \nFig. 4. Characterization of green versus sustainable versus renewable versus clean energy' types\n\nGreen energy is a more specific category of renewable energy that provides higher \nenvironmental benefits than renewables. It can also reduce carbon footprints, air pollution, and \nwater environmental costs. However, green energy possesses geographic limitations and offers \nintermittent production peaks depending on weather conditions.\nSustainable energy aims to limit GHG emissions while preserving the natural integrity of the \nenvironment. An energy source can be sustainable as long as the rate of resource harvest stays \nbelow the rate of natural resource replenishment. Harvesting, utilizing, operating, and building \ninfrastructure are all areas where the energies could become unsustainable. \nGreen energy is important for the environment as it replaces the negative effects of fossil fuels \nwith more environmentally-friendly alternatives. Derived from natural resources, green energy is \nalso often renewable and clean, meaning that they emit no or few greenhouse gases and are often \nreadily available.\nEven when the full life cycle of a green energy source is taken into consideration, they release far \nless greenhouse gases than fossil fuels, as well as few or low levels of air pollutants. This is not \njust good for the planet but is also better for the health of people and animals that have to breathe \nthe air.\nGreen energy can also lead to stable energy prices as these sources are often produced locally \nand are not as affected by geopolitical crisis, price spikes or supply chain disruptions. The \neconomic benefits also include job creation in building the facilities that often serve the \ncommunities where the workers are employed. Renewable energy saw the creation of 11 million \njobs worldwide in 2018, with this number set to grow as we strive to meet targets such as net \nzero.\nDue to the local nature of energy production through sources like solar and wind power, the \nenergy infrastructure is more flexible and less dependent on centralized sources that can lead to \ndisruption as well as being less resilient to weather related climate change.\nMany industries are investigating green solutions and here are a few examples:\nHeating and Cooling in Buildings\nGreen energy solutions are being used for buildings ranging from large office blocks to people's \nhomes. These include solar water heaters, biomass fueled boilers and direct heat from \ngeothermal, as well as cooling systems powered by renewable sources.\nIndustrial Processes\nRenewable heat for industrial processes can be run using biomass or renewable electricity. \nHydrogen is now a large provider of renewable energy for the cement, iron, steel and chemical \nindustries.\nTransport\nSustainable biofuels and renewable electricity are growing in use for transportation across \nmultiple industry sectors. Automotive is an obvious example as electrification advances to \nreplace fossil fuels, but aerospace and construction are other areas that are actively investigating \nelectrification.\nGreen energy has the capacity to replace fossil fuels in the future, however it may require \nvaried production from different means to achieve this.\nCan It Be Economically Viable?\nUnderstanding the economic viability of green energy requires a comparison with fossil fuels. \nThe fact is that as easily-reached fossil resources begin to run out, the cost of this type of energy \nwill only increase with scarcity.\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, about 80 percent of the world's energy supply was derived \nfrom fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Fossil fuels are finite resources; most \nestimates suggest that the proven reserves of oil are large enough to meet global demand at least \nuntil the middle of the 21st century. Fossil fuel combustion has a number of negative \nenvironmental consequences. Fossil-fueled power plants emit air pollutants such as sulfur \ndioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and toxic chemicals (heavy metals: mercury, \nchromium, and arsenic), and mobile sources, such as fossil-fueled vehicles, emit nitrogen oxides, \ncarbon monoxide, and particulate matter. Exposure to these pollutants can cause heart disease, \nasthma, and other human health problems. In addition, emissions from fossil fuel combustion are \nresponsible for acid rain, which has led to the acidification of many lakes and consequent \ndamage to aquatic life, leaf damage in many forests, and the production of smog in or near many \nurban areas. Furthermore, the burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO2), one of the \nmain greenhouse gases that cause global warming.\nAt the same time as the fossil fuels become more expensive, the cost of greener energy sources is \nfalling. Other factors also work in favor of green energy, such as the ability to produce relatively \ninexpensive localized energy solutions, such as solar farms. The interest, investment and \ndevelopment of green energy solutions is bringing costs down as we continue to build up our \nknowledge and are able to build on past breakthroughs.\nIn the following part the renewable energy solutions will be developed, meaning green and \nsustainable or only renewable. It is usable energy derived from replenishable sources such as the \nSun (solar energy), wind (wind power), rivers (hydroelectric power), hot springs (geothermal \nenergy), tides (tidal power), biomass (biofuels), green hydrogen by the electrolysis of water, and \nsolid wastes biotransformation into energy by circular bioeconomy solutions.\nThis last subject will be developed in the next module dedicated to circular economy & \nbioeconomy.\nThere are important benefits of renewable energy:\n 1. Improves Public Health\nThe burning of fossil fuels in coal and natural gas plants is directly tied with many serious public \nhealth issues, such as neurological damage, cancer, heart attacks, breathing problems and \npremature death. When fossil fuels are burned for energy, they release air and water pollution \nthat negatively affect surrounding communities and environments.\nHowever, all of these associated risks can be eliminated by switching to sustainable energy. \nSustainable energy sources typically emit no air or water pollutants that can harm public health. \nThey also don't make a negative impact or strain on local water resources. Meanwhile, coal \nmining, natural gas drilling and thermal power plants all compete with local agriculture, drinking \nwater and other important community water needs for resources.\n 2. Creates Local Jobs\nSustainable energy can also help fuel your local communities. Since most facilities and \nsustainable energy infrastructure must be built locally or in the same county, making the switch \nhelps create jobs and improve the economy. Instead of spending more money importing energy \nfrom fossil fuel companies, that money is spent on materials and workmanship to maintain \nsustainable energy facilities.\n 3. Decreases Your Carbon Footprint \nWe're all doing our best to reduce our negative impact on the environment, but there is only so \nmuch each person can do. Sustainable energy, such as wind and solar energy, creates zero carbon \nemissions that can harm the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. It offsets the need for \nfossil fuels, which are actively increasing climate change and polluting our earth.\nSimply switching your own home's energy source can help cut the environmental impact you \nand your family have on the planet - and eliminate your dependence on fossil fuels.\n 4. Long-term Cost is More Affordable\nSustainable energy can make a huge long-term difference to the electricity and energy costs of \nour homes and businesses - no matter where you are. Not only are they easily available for little \nto no cost, but they're much more cost-effective than traditional energy resources, such as power \nplants. Making the financial leap to wind, solar or any other sustainable energy source may seem \ndaunting at first because of installation costs, but the long-term investment pays off in just a few \nyears. In fact, sustainable energy costs decrease each and every year. Depending on your country \nor state, you may even get tax reductions for choosing sustainable energy. Ultimately, you could \nend up saving exponentially just by making the switch to a sustainable energy system like solar \npanels.\n 5. Energy Security\nSustainable energy is by definition the most reliable form of energy. It will never deplete and can \nremove our reliance on imported fossil fuels, which are growing more expensive and less \naccessible. Sustainable energy also helps to conserve the planet's natural resources and reduce \nthe pollution associated with unsustainable energy.\nThe economic efficiency\nCurrently, wind farms are seen as the most efficient source of green energy as it requires less \nrefining and processing than the production of, for example, solar panels. Advances in \ncomposites technology and testing has helped improve the life-span and therefore the energy cost \nof wind turbines. However, the same can be said of solar panels, which are also seeing a great \ndeal of development.\nRenewable energy sources are currently ranked as follows in efficiency (although this may \nchange as developments continue):\n1.\tWind Power\n2.\tGeothermal\n3.\tHydropower\n4.\tNuclear (to remind: clean energy, as a matter of fact)\n5.\tSolar Power\nFor the other types of renewable energy sources, the comparison is under scrutiny, depending on \nthe technological advancement.\nRenewable energy sources accounted for nearly 20 percent of global energy consumption at the \nbeginning of the 21st century, largely from traditional uses of biomass such as wood for heating \nand cooking. By 2015 about 16 percent of the world's total electricity came from large \nhydroelectric power plants, whereas other types of renewable energy (such as solar, wind, and \ngeothermal) accounted for 6 percent of total electricity generation. Some energy analysts \nconsider nuclear power to be a form of renewable energy because of its low carbon emissions; \nnuclear power generated 10.6 percent of the world's electricity in 2015.\nGrowth in wind power exceeded 20 percent and photovoltaics grew at 30 percent annually in the \n1990s, and renewable energy technologies continued to expand throughout the early 21st \ncentury. Between 2001 and 2017 world total installed wind power capacity increased by a factor \nof 22, growing from 23,900 to 539,581 megawatts. Photovoltaic capacity also expanded, \nincreasing by 50 percent in 2016 alone. The European Union (EU), which produced an estimated \n6.38 percent of its energy from renewable sources in 2005, adopted a goal in 2007 to raise that \nfigure to 20 percent by 2020. By 2016 some 17 percent of the EU's energy came from renewable \nsources. The goal also included plans to cut emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 percent and to \nensure that 10 percent of all fuel consumption comes from biofuels. The EU was well on its way \nto achieving those targets by 2017. Between 1990 and 2016 the countries of the EU reduced \ncarbon emissions by 23 percent and increased biofuel production to 5.5 percent of all fuels \nconsumed in the region.\n \nFig. 5. Barriers to renewable energy development\nTechnical barriers are mainly concerned with the technology to harvest available and viable \nrenewable energy resources (RER). This starts from RERs availability, feasibility and viability, \ninfrastructure, grid connectivity and capacity, the human factor of skilled labor, and technical \nexpertise. \nThe term variable renewable energy (VRE) is usually used to refer to solar and wind RERs, due \nto their high intermittent nature, compared to other RERs. In this regard, storage energy systems \n(SESs) have been widely viewed as an ultimate solution to smooth the RERs power generation \nscheme.\nThe European Commission has set up a fair transition mechanism to finance the green reform to \na climate-neutral economy. This mechanism consists of three main sources of funding: (1) A \nJust Transition Fund, which will be financed with new Community funds of 7.5 billion, in \naddition to the Commission's proposal for the next long-term budget of the European Union, (2) \na special regime of fair transition within the framework of Invest EU for the mobilization of \ninvestments and finding new sources of growth, and (3) a public sector lending mechanism in \ncooperation with the European Investment Bank.\nWIND POWER\nBy 2016 wind was contributing approximately 4 percent of the world's total electricity. \nElectricity generation by wind has been increasing dramatically because of concerns over the \ncost of petroleum and the effects of fossil fuel combustion on the climate and environment. From \n2007 to 2016, for example, total installed wind power capacity quintupled from 95 gigawatts to \n487 gigawatts worldwide. In 2016 Denmark generated the largest percentage of its electricity \nfrom wind (nearly 38 percent). The wind power industry estimates that the world could feasibly \ngenerate nearly 20 percent of its total electricity from wind power by 2030. Various estimates put \nthe cost of wind energy as low as 2-6 cents per kilowatt-hour, depending on the location. This is \ncomparable to the cost of coal, natural gas, and other forms of fossil energy, which ranges \nbetween 5 and 17 cents per kilowatt-hour.\nChallenges to the large-scale implementation of wind energy include siting requirements such as \nwind availability, aesthetic and environmental concerns, and land availability. Wind farms are \nmost cost-effective in areas with consistent strong winds; however, these areas are not \nnecessarily near large population centres. Thus, power lines and other components of electrical \ndistribution systems must have the capacity to transmit this electricity to consumers. In addition, \nsince wind is an intermittent and inconsistent power source, storing power may be necessary. \nPublic advocacy groups have raised concerns about the potential disruptions that wind farms \nmay have on wildlife and overall aesthetics. Although wind generators have been blamed for \ninjuring and killing birds, experts have shown that modern turbines have a small effect on bird \npopulations. The National Audubon Society, a large environmental group based in the United \nStates and focused on the conservation of birds and other wildlife, is strongly in favour of wind \npower, provided that wind farms are appropriately sited to minimize the impacts on migrating \nbird populations and important wildlife habitat.\nIn the case of wind energy, the most common and widely applied conversion approach is to \nconvert wind energy into electrical energy using wind turbines coupled with an electrical \ngenerator. \n \nFig. 5. Wind turbine structure (Source: Encyclopedia Britanica)\nWhile large-scale wind turbines are a mature technology that can be sited within or close to cities \nwhere good wind resources are identified, small-scale wind turbines sited on or near buildings \nare still emerging. Small wind turbines are currently more costly and less efficient than large \nones and will require further development if they are to make a noticeable contribution to urban \nenergy supply. \nA major challenge for urban small wind will continue to be proper siting and cost control. Due to \ntheir smaller scale and relative cost, long-term wind speed monitoring can be impractical for \nthese projects. \nLooking to the future, as wind energy and other forms of variable renewable generation increase, \nflexible energy resources will likely be needed to keep supply and demand on the grid in \nbalance. Energy storage technologies and demand response will be among the options for \nproviding this flexibility in a low-carbon energy system. Batteries, flywheels, compressed air and \nother forms of energy storage may be utilized to store renewable power when it is in excess for \nfuture use when demand would otherwise exceed supply. However, the viability of energy \nstorage as a grid balancing solution will depend on the cost of these technologies as compared to \navailable alternatives 'Smart grid' investments in advanced meters and appliances capable of \nsending and receiving signals to control electricity demand in real time are one such alternative. \nIndeed, as renewable supplies that fluctuate with changes in wind or solar availability become \nubiquitous, it will become more important that the electric grid be an intelligent and dynamic \nenergy system, capable of utilizing a number of different options and techniques for controlling \nsupply and demand.\nDespite the fact that wind energy technology is highly popular, there are certain issues that limit \nits use. The efficiency and practical usability of wind energy technology depend on the reliability \nand lifetime of wind turbines. The repair and maintenance of wind turbines are typically quite \nexpensive and labor consuming.\nIssues with regard to the environment and public perception are also important:\nNoise pollution: Noise is disturbing for some people. There are two main sources of noise from a \nwind turbine - mechanical noise from the gearbox and generator, and aerodynamic noise from \nthe rotor blades. Aerodynamic noise is the major component of the total noise and resembles the \nswish sound created by a helicopter. At 400 m downwind, the turbine noise can be as high as 60 \ndB, which is comparable to the noise level from an air conditioner or dishwasher. However, the \nnoise from wind farms is far below the threshold of pain, which is 140 dB. Furthermore noise \nhas been reduced substantially with the advent of new and improved designed wind turbines.\nAesthetics: Some people perceive wind farms as ugly for the landscape, forcing developers to \ninstall them in remote areas, including offshore.\nBird collisions: Some instances of birds colliding with the rotating blades are reported. However, \nthe problem can be reduced to a great extent with newer turbines being designed with lower \nblade speeds.\nIce accumulation: In cold weather regions, ice can accumulate on the blades. When the turbine \nspins, the ice can be dislodged and such projectiles endanger the public and structures in the \nvicinity. In some models the blades are heated to avoid the ice from accumulating on them.\nIt is to work with industry partners to increase the performance and reliability of next-generation \nwind technologies while lowering the cost of wind energy. The office's research efforts have \nhelped to increase the average capacity factor (a measure of power plant productivity) from 22% \nfor wind turbines installed before 1998 to an average of nearly 35% today, up from 30% in 2000. \nWind energy costs have been reduced from over 55 cents (current dollars) per kilowatt-hour \n(kWh) in 1980 to an average of under 3 cents per kWh in the USA today. To ensure future \nindustry growth, wind industry technology must continue to evolve, building on earlier successes \nto further improve reliability, increase capacity factors, and reduce costs.\nSOLAR ENERGY\nSolar energy is determined by the radiation from the Sun capable of producing heat, causing \nchemical reactions, or generating electricity. The total amount of solar energy incident on Earth \nis vastly in excess of the world's current and anticipated energy requirements. If suitably \nharnessed, this highly diffused source has the potential to satisfy all future energy needs. In the \n21st century solar energy is expected to become increasingly attractive as a renewable energy \nsource because of its inexhaustible supply and its nonpolluting character.\nSolar energy is available everywhere and is already commercially applied in several sectors, \neither solar thermal or electrical energy. The widespread of solar photo-voltaic (PV) systems \nrequires efficient energy storage systems. Batteries are the most affordable energy storage that \nare available in different sizes.\n \nFig. 6. Reflection and absorption of solar energy (Source: Merriam-Webster Inc.)\nThe Sun is an extremely powerful energy source, and sunlight is by far the largest source of \nenergy received by Earth, but its intensity at Earth's surface is actually quite low. This is \nessentially because of the enormous radial spreading of radiation from the distant Sun. A \nrelatively minor additional loss is due to Earth's atmosphere and clouds, which absorb or scatter \nas much as 54 percent of the incoming sunlight. The sunlight that reaches the ground consists of \nnearly 50 percent visible light, 45 percent infrared radiation, and smaller amounts of ultraviolet \nand other forms of electromagnetic radiation.\nThe potential for solar energy is enormous, since about 200,000 times the world's total daily \nelectric-generating capacity is received by Earth every day in the form of solar energy. \nUnfortunately, though solar energy itself is free, the high cost of its collection, conversion, and \nstorage still limits its exploitation in many places. Solar radiation can be converted either into \nthermal energy (heat) or into electrical energy, though the former is easier to accomplish.\n\n\n \nFig. 7. Photo-voltaic power potential on Earth (Source: Encyclopedia Britanica)\na)\tThermal energy\n \nFig. 8. A building roof with flat-plate collectors that capture solar energy to heat air or water.\nAmong the most common devices used to capture solar energy and convert it to thermal energy \nare flat-plate collectors, which are used for solar heating applications. Because the intensity of \nsolar radiation at Earth's surface is so low, these collectors must be large in area. Even in sunny \nparts of the world's temperate regions, for instance, a collector must have a surface area of about \n40 square meters to gather enough energy to serve the energy needs of one person.\nThe most widely used flat-plate collectors consist of a blackened metal plate, covered with one \nor two sheets of glass, that is heated by the sunlight falling on it. This heat is then transferred to \nair or water, called carrier fluids, that flow past the back of the plate. The heat may be used \ndirectly, or it may be transferred to another medium for storage. Flat-plate collectors are \ncommonly used for solar water heaters and house heating. The storage of heat for use at night or \non cloudy days is commonly accomplished by using insulated tanks to store the water heated \nduring sunny periods. Such a system can supply a home with hot water drawn from the storage \ntank, or, with the warmed water flowing through tubes in floors and ceilings, it can provide space \nheating. Flat-plate collectors typically heat carrier fluids to temperatures ranging from 66 to 93 \n°C. The efficiency of such collectors (i.e., the proportion of the energy received that they convert \ninto usable energy) ranges from 20 to 80 percent, depending on the design of the collector.\nAnother method of thermal energy conversion is found in solar ponds, which are bodies of salt \nwater designed to collect and store solar energy. The heat extracted from such ponds enables the \nproduction of chemicals, food, textiles, and other industrial products and can also be used to \nwarm greenhouses, swimming pools, and livestock buildings. Solar ponds are sometimes used to \nproduce electricity through the use of the organic Rankine cycle engine, a relatively efficient and \neconomical means of solar energy conversion, which is especially useful in remote locations. \nSolar ponds are fairly expensive to install and maintain and are generally limited to warm rural \nareas.\nOn a smaller scale, the Sun's energy can also be harnessed to cook food in specially designed \nsolar ovens. Solar ovens typically concentrate sunlight from over a wide area to a central point, \nwhere a black-surfaced vessel converts the sunlight into heat. The ovens are typically portable \nand require no other fuel inputs.\nb)\tElectricity generation\nSolar radiation may be converted directly into electricity by solar cells (photovoltaic cells). In \nsuch cells, a small electric voltage is generated when light strikes the junction between a metal \nand a semiconductor (such as silicon) or the junction between two different semiconductors. The \npower generated by a single photovoltaic cell is typically only about two watts. By connecting \nlarge numbers of individual cells together, however, as in solar-panel arrays, hundreds or even \nthousands of kilowatts of electric power can be generated in a solar electric plant or in a large \nhousehold array. The energy efficiency of most present-day photovoltaic cells is only about 15 to \n20 percent, and, since the intensity of solar radiation is low to begin with, large and costly \nassemblies of such cells are required to produce even moderate amounts of power.\nWhen sunlight strikes a solar cell, an electron is freed by the photoelectric effect. The two \ndissimilar semiconductors possess a natural difference in electric potential (voltage), which \ncauses the electrons to flow through the external circuit, supplying power to the load. The flow \nof electricity results from the characteristics of the semiconductors and is powered entirely by \nlight striking the cell.\n\n \nFig. 9. Photo-voltaic solar cell (Source: Encyclopedia Britanica)\nSmall photovoltaic cells that operate on sunlight or artificial light have found major use in low-\npower applications-as power sources for calculators and watches, for example. Larger units \nhave been used to provide power for water pumps and communications systems in remote areas \nand for weather and communications satellites. Classic crystalline silicon panels and emerging \ntechnologies using thin-film solar cells, including building-integrated photovoltaics, can be \ninstalled by homeowners and businesses on their rooftops to replace or augment the conventional \nelectric supply.\n \n \na)\tConcentrated solar power plant\nb)\tSolar reflector\n\n\nFig. 10. Solar power units (Source: Encyclopedia Britanica)\nConcentrated solar power plants employ concentrating, or focusing, collectors to concentrate \nsunlight received from a wide area onto a small blackened receiver, thereby considerably \nincreasing the light's intensity in order to produce high temperatures. The arrays of carefully \naligned mirrors or lenses can focus enough sunlight to heat a target to temperatures of 2,000 °C \nor more. This heat can then be used to operate a boiler, which in turn generates steam for a steam \nturbine electric generator power plant. For producing steam directly, the movable mirrors can be \narranged so as to concentrate large amounts of solar radiation upon blackened pipes through \nwhich water is circulated and thereby heated.\nSolar energy is also used on a small scale for purposes other than those described above. In some \ncountries, for instance, solar energy is used to produce salt from seawater by evaporation. \nSimilarly, solar-powered desalination units transform salt water into drinking water by \nconverting the Sun's energy to heat, directly or indirectly, to drive the desalination process.\nSolar technology has also emerged for the clean and renewable production of hydrogen as an \nalternative energy source. Mimicking the process of photosynthesis, artificial leaves are silicon-\nbased devices that use solar energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, leaving virtually no \npollutants. Further work is needed to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these \ndevices for industrial use.\nWith the technological developments in solar panels, the efficiency of commercial modules has \nreached 12%-22%. The lack of expected improvements in the efficiency of thin-film solar panels \nhas significantly reduced in the market share of these panels. In addition, the increase in the cost \nof lens and tracking systems in concentrated PV modules has decreased the market share of these \nsystems. Therefore, new studies are carried out to increase cell and module efficiency.\nSolar panels can perform a part of our energy needs. Fig. 11 shows the evolution of renewable \nenergy annual installations over the last 11 years. The development of solar energy among \nrenewable energy sources can be seen in this figure. Solar panels have shown an ever-increasing \nmarket growth in electricity generation, thanks to their technology and price. In fact, solar energy \nsees as for approximately 40% of the total renewable electricity generation in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 11. Evolution of renewable energy annual installations (global level) (Source: World Bank)\n\nThe benefits arising from the installation and operation of solar energy systems are \nenvironmental and socioeconomical.\nFrom an environmental point of view, the use of solar energy technologies has several positive \nimplications which include: (a) Reduction of the emission of the greenhouse gasses (mainly CO2, \nNOx) and of toxic gas emissions (SO2, particulates). (b) Reclamation of degraded land (c) \nReduced requirement for transmission lines within the electricity grid (d) Improvement of the \nwater resources quality.\nThe socioeconomic benefits of solar technologies include: (a) Increased regional/national energy \nindependence. (b) Creation of employment opportunities. (c) Restructuring of energy markets \ndue to penetration of a new technology and the growth of new production activities. (d) \nDiversification, security, and stability of energy supply. (e) Acceleration of electrification of \nrural communities in isolated areas\nIt is worth noting that no artificial project can completely avoid some impact to the environment. \nThe negative environmental aspects of solar energy systems include: (a) Pollution stemming \nfrom production, installation, maintenance, and demolition of the systems. (b) Noise during \nconstruction. (c) Land displacement (d) Visual intrusion.\nConsidering a 60% transmittance through the atmospheric cloud cover, 1.05×105 TW reaches the \nearth's surface continuously. If the irradiance on only 1% of the earth's surface could be \nconverted into electric energy with a 10% efficiency, it would provide a resource base of 105 \nTW, while the total global energy needs for 2050 are projected to be about 25-30 TW. The \npresent state of solar energy technologies is such that single solar cell efficiencies have reached \nover 20% with concentrating PV at about 40% and solar thermal systems provide efficiencies of \n40-60%.\nSolar PV panels have come down in cost from about $30 W-1 to about $3 W-1 in the last three \ndecades. At $3 W-1 panel cost, the overall system cost is around $6 W-1, which is still too high \nfor the average consumer. However, there are many off-grid applications where solar PV is \nalready cost-effective. With net metering and governmental incentives, such as feed-in laws and \nother policies, grid-connected applications such as building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) \nhave become cost-effective. As a result, the worldwide growth in PV production is more than \n30% per year (average) during the past 5 years.\nSolar thermal power using concentrating solar collectors was the first solar technology that \ndemonstrated its grid power potential. Progress in solar thermal power stalled after that time \nbecause of poor policy and lack of R&D. However, the last 5 years have seen a resurgence of \ninterest in this area, and a number of solar thermal power plants around the world are under \nconstruction. The cost of power from these plants (which is so far in the range of $0.12-$0.16 \nkWh-1) has the potential to go down to $0.05 kWh-1 with scale-up and creation of a mass \nmarket. An advantage of solar thermal power is that thermal energy can be stored efficiently and \nfuels such as natural gas or biogas may be used as back-up to ensure continuous operation.\nIn this volume, emphasis is given to solar thermal systems. Solar thermal systems are \nnonpolluting and offer significant protection to the environment. The reduction of greenhouse \ngasses is the main advantage of utilizing solar energy. Therefore, solar thermal systems should \nbe employed whenever possible in order to achieve a sustainable future. \nIn terms of technology, solar photovoltaic (PV) is a perfect example of technological \nadvancement. The 3rd generation solar PV cells are currently employed, and they overcome \nmany of the challenges associated with energy efficiency and cost. The advancements in solar \nPV cells have led to lower costs, less energy-intensive manufacturing processes, and the use of \navailable material resources (i.e., avoiding the use of precious metals). One of the main \nchallenges of PV projects is their connectivity to the power grid, which is mainly due to their \nintermittent nature.\nHYDROPOWER\nAs the second largest renewable electricity source, hydropower continues to be an important \nenergy source today. According to Eurostat, it accounted in 2021 for 32% of the EU's renewable \nelectricity production and provided 12% of the EU's electricity.\n \nFig. 12 Hydropower generation in Europe, 2022 (Source: EU Directorate for Environment)\n \nFig 13. Europe dominated the global market in 2022 (Source: www.precedenceresearch.com)\n \nFig. 14. Recorded hydropower plants in Europe (Source: European Environmental Agency), \n2022\nHydroelectric power (later only called hydropower) is a renewable energy source, where \nelectrical energy is derived from the potential energy of water moving from higher to lower \nelevations.\nHydroelectric power is electricity produced from generators driven by turbines that convert the \npotential energy of falling or fast-flowing water into mechanical energy. In the early 21st \ncentury, hydroelectric power was the most widely utilized form of renewable energy; in 2019 it \naccounted for more than 18 percent of the world's total power generation capacity.\nIn the generation of hydroelectric power, water is collected or stored at a higher elevation and led \ndownward through large pipes or tunnels (penstocks) to a lower elevation; the difference in these \ntwo elevations is known as the head. At the end of its passage down the pipes, the falling water \ncauses turbines to rotate. The turbines in turn drive generators, which convert the turbines' \nmechanical energy into electricity. Transformers are then used to convert the alternating voltage \nsuitable for the generators to a higher voltage suitable for long-distance transmission. The \nstructure that houses the turbines and generators, and into which the pipes or penstocks feed, is \ncalled the powerhouse.\n\n \nFig. 15. Hydroelectric power plant's structure (Source: Encyclopedia Britanica)\nHydroelectric power plants are usually located in dams that impound rivers, thereby raising the \nlevel of the water behind the dam and creating as high a head as is feasible. The potential power \nthat can be derived from a volume of water is directly proportional to the working head, so that a \nhigh-head installation requires a smaller volume of water than a low-head installation to produce \nan equal amount of power. In some dams, the powerhouse is constructed on one flank of the \ndam, part of the dam being used as a spillway over which excess water is discharged in times of \nflood. Where the river flows in a narrow steep gorge, the powerhouse may be located within the \ndam itself.\nIn most communities the demand for electric power varies considerably at different times of the \nday. To even the load on the generators, pumped-storage hydroelectric stations are occasionally \nbuilt. During off-peak periods, some of the extra power available is supplied to the generator \noperating as a motor, driving the turbine to pump water into an elevated reservoir. Then, during \nperiods of peak demand, the water is allowed to flow down again through the turbine to generate \nelectrical energy. Pumped-storage systems are efficient and provide an economical way to meet \npeak loads.\nHydroelectric power is the largest and cheapest renewable electricity source in the world, \nalthough biomass easily surpasses it when other energy applications are considered. Even so, \nhydroelectric power releases no direct greenhouse gas emissions and is a significant source of \npower in many parts of the world.\nHydroelectric power has certain advantages over these other sources. It is continually renewable \nowing to the recurring nature of the hydrologic cycle. It does not produce thermal pollution. \n(However, some dams can produce methane from the decomposition of vegetation under water.) \nHydroelectric power is a preferred energy source in areas with heavy rainfall and with hilly or \nmountainous regions that are in reasonably close proximity to the main load centers. Some large \nhydro sites that are remote from load centers may be sufficiently attractive to justify the long \nhigh-voltage transmission lines. Small local hydro sites may also be economical, particularly if \nthey combine storage of water during light loads with electricity production during peaks. It \nrequires relatively high initial investment, but has a long life span with very low operation and \nmaintenance costs. It is a proven, mature, predictable and price competitive technology. \nHydropower has the best conversion efficiencies among all known energy sources (about 90 % \nefficiency, water to wire). Hydropower has an energy payback ratio of 200-300, highest of all \ntypes of renewable energies. Hydropower can provide both energy and water management \nservices and also help to support other variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, \nby providing storage and load balancing services.\nMany of the negative environmental impacts of hydroelectric power come from the associated \ndams, which can interrupt the migrations of spawning fish, such as salmon, and permanently \nsubmerge or displace ecological and human communities as the reservoirs fill. In addition, \nhydroelectric dams are vulnerable to water scarcity. This is not to say that hydro power is \nwithout adverse environmental impacts, however. Large-scale dams are well known to lead to \nsignificant ecological damages, including loss of biodiversity, localized deforestation, soil \nerosion, and disruption of free-flowing rivers, as well as displacement of large numbers of \nhumans in many cases.\nTable 1.

Tidal currents with sufficient \nenergy for harvesting occur when water passes through a constriction, causing the water to move \nfaster.\nTidal energy is produced by the surge of ocean waters during the rise and fall of tides. Tidal \nenergy is a renewable source of energy. During the 20th century, engineers developed ways to \nuse tidal movement to generate electricity in areas where there is a significant tidal range-the \ndifference in area between high tide and low tide. All methods use special generators to convert \ntidal energy into electricity. Tidal energy production is still in its infancy. The amount of power \nproduced so far has been small. There are very few commercial-sized tidal power plants \noperating in the world. The first was located in La Rance, France. The largest tidal plants and \nonly a few sites where tidal energy could be produced at a reasonable price.\nTidal Energy Generators\nThere are currently three different ways to get tidal energy: tidal streams, barrages, and tidal \nlagoons.\nFor most tidal energy generators, turbines are placed in tidal streams. A tidal stream is a fast-\nflowing body of water created by tides. A turbine is a machine that takes energy from a flow of \nfluid. That fluid can be air (wind) or liquid (water). Because water is much denser than air, tidal \nenergy is more powerful than wind energy. Unlike wind, tides are predictable and stable. Where \ntidal generators are used, they produce a steady, reliable stream of electricity.\nPlacing turbines in tidal streams is complex, because the machines are large and disrupt the tide \nthey are trying to harness. The environmental impact could be severe, depending on the size of \nthe turbine and the site of the tidal stream. Turbines are most effective in shallow water. This \nproduces more energy and allows ships to navigate around the turbines. A tidal generator's \nturbine blades also turn slowly, which helps marine life avoid getting caught in the system. The \nworld's first tidal power station was constructed in 2007 at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland. \nThe turbines are placed in a narrow strait between the Strangford Lough inlet and the Irish Sea. \nThe tide can move at 4 meters per second across the strait.\nAnother type of tidal energy generator uses a large dam called a barrage. With a barrage, water \ncan spill over the top or through turbines in the dam because the dam is low. Barrages can be \nconstructed across tidal rivers, bays, and estuaries. Turbines inside the barrage harness the power \nof tides the same way a river dam harnesses the power of a river. The barrage gates are open as \nthe tide rises. At high tide, the barrage gates close, creating a pool, or tidal lagoon. The water is \nthen released through the barrage's turbines, creating energy at a rate that can be controlled by \nengineers.\nThe environmental impact of a barrage system can be quite significant. The land in the tidal \nrange is completely disrupted. The change in water level in the tidal lagoon might harm plant and \nanimal life. The salinity inside the tidal lagoon lowers, which changes the organisms that are able \nto live there. As with dams across rivers, fish are blocked into or out of the tidal lagoon. Turbines \nmove quickly in barrages, and marine animals can be caught in the blades. With their food \nsource limited, birds might find different places to migrate. A barrage is a much more expensive \ntidal energy generator than a single turbine. Although there are no fuel costs, barrages involve \nmore construction and more machines. Unlike single turbines, barrages also require constant \nsupervision to adjust power output. The tidal power plant at the Rance River estuary in Brittany, \nFrance, uses a barrage. It was built in 1966 and is still functioning. The plant uses two sources of \nenergy: tidal energy from the English Channel and river current energy from the Rance River. \nThe barrage has led to an increased level of silt in the habitat. Native aquatic plants suffocate in \nsilt, and a flatfish called plaice is now extinct in the area. Other organisms, such as cuttlefish, a \nrelative of squids, now thrive in the Rance estuary. Cuttlefish prefer cloudy, silty ecosystems.\nThe final type of tidal energy generator involves the construction of tidal lagoons. A tidal lagoon \nis a body of ocean water that is partly enclosed by a natural or manmade barrier. Tidal lagoons \nmight also be estuaries and have freshwater emptying into them. A tidal energy generator using \ntidal lagoons would function much like a barrage. Unlike barrages, however, tidal lagoons can be \nconstructed along the natural coastline. A tidal lagoon power plant could also generate \ncontinuous power. The turbines work as the lagoon is filling and emptying. The environmental \nimpact of tidal lagoons is minimal. The lagoons can be constructed with natural materials like \nrock. They would appear as a low breakwater (sea wall) at low tide, and be submerged at high \ntide. Animals could swim around the structure, and smaller organisms could swim inside it. \nLarge predators like sharks would not be able to penetrate the lagoon, so smaller fish would \nprobably thrive. Birds would likely flock to the area. But the energy output from generators \nusing tidal lagoons is likely to be low. There are no functioning examples yet. \n \nFig. 16. Tidal power generating systems (Source: Encyclopedia Britanica)\nGlobally, tidal power could potentially produce between 150 and 800 terawatt hours of \nrenewable energy per year-at the upper end, that's more than Canada's energy production from \nwind, water, nuclear, fossil fuels, and other sources combined in 2019.\nFor tidal power generation, location is everything. To produce energy, tidal generators need fast \ncurrents or a sizable swing in sea level between high tide and low tide.\nb)\tWave power\nWave power is also renewable energy representing the capture of energy of wind waves to do \nuseful work - for example, electricity generation, water desalination, or pumping water.\n \nFig. 17. Wave power\nThere are several methods of harnessing wave energy that involve placing electricity generators \non the surface of the ocean.\nWave power is typically produced by floating turbine platforms or buoys that rise and fall with \nthe swells. However, wave power can be generated by exploiting the changes in air pressure \noccurring in wave capture chambers that face the sea or changes in wave pressure on the ocean \nfloor.\nThe areas of greatest potential for wave energy development are in the latitudes with the highest \nwinds (latitudes 40°-60° N and S) on the eastern shores of the world's oceans (which border the \nwestern edges of the continents). For instance, the world's first operational wave power \ngenerator is located off the coast of Aguçadora, Portugal, producing as much as 2.25 megawatts \nfrom three huge jointed tubes that float on the surface of the Atlantic Ocean; individual power \ngenerators are located at the tubes' joints and activated by wave motion. \n \nFig. 18. Floating turbine to produce wave power \nDespite the enormous energy potential of wave power, technical challenges remain. Research \nfunding is low compared with that supporting solar, wind, and other renewable forms of energy, \nand thus the process of experimentation and refinements with different wave energy collector \ndesigns is not as well developed. The development of massive machines for use in the oceans is \nexpensive; salt water in the oceans corrodes steel and other metals, and the physical force of the \nwaves fatigues wave energy collectors, transmission wires, and other infrastructure over time.\nGEOTHERMAL ENERGY\nGeothermal energy is a natural resource and form of energy conversion in which heat energy \nfrom within Earth is captured and harnessed for cooking, bathing, space heating, electrical power \ngeneration, and other uses.\nHeat from Earth's interior generates surface phenomena such as lava flows, geysers, fumaroles, \nhot springs, and mud pots. The heat is produced mainly by the radioactive decay of potassium, \nthorium, and uranium in Earth's crust and mantle and also by friction generated along the \nmargins of continental plates. The subsequent annual low-grade heat flow to the surface averages \nbetween 50 and 70 milliwatts (mW) per square meter worldwide. In contrast, incoming solar \nradiation striking Earth's surface provides 342 watts per square meter annually (see solar \nenergy). Geothermal heat energy can be recovered and exploited for human use, and it is \navailable anywhere on Earth's surface. The estimated energy that can be recovered and utilized \non the surface is 4.5 × 106 exajoules, or about 1.4 × 106 terawatt-years, which equates to roughly \nthree times the world's annual consumption of all types of energy.\nThe amount of usable energy from geothermal sources varies with depth and by extraction \nmethod. The increase in temperature of rocks and other materials underground averages 20-30 \n°C kilometer depth worldwide in the upper part of the lithosphere, and this rate of increase is \nmuch higher in most of Earth's known geothermal areas. Normally, heat extraction requires a \nfluid (or steam) to bring the energy to the surface. Locating and developing geothermal resources \ncan be challenging. This is especially true for the high-temperature resources needed for \ngenerating electricity. Such resources are typically limited to parts of the world characterized by \nrecent volcanic activity or located along plate boundaries or within crustal hot spots. Even \nthough there is a continuous source of heat within Earth, the extraction rate of the heated fluids \nand steam can exceed the replenishment rate, and, thus, use of the resource must be managed \nsustainably.\nUses\nGeothermal energy use can be divided into three categories: direct-use applications, geothermal \nheat pumps (GHPs), and electric power generation.\nDirect uses\nProbably the most widely used set of applications involves the direct use of heated water from \nthe ground without the need for any specialized equipment. All direct-use applications make use \nof low-temperature geothermal resources, which range between about 50 and 150 °C. Such low-\ntemperature geothermal water and steam have been used to warm single buildings, as well as \nwhole districts where numerous buildings are heated from a central supply source. In addition, \nmany swimming pools, balneological (therapeutic) facilities at spas, greenhouses, and \naquaculture ponds around the world have been heated with geothermal resources. Other direct \nuses of geothermal energy include cooking, industrial applications (such as drying fruit, \nvegetables, and timber), milk pasteurization, and large-scale snow melting. For many of those \nactivities, hot water is often used directly in the heating system, or it may be used in conjunction \nwith a heat exchanger, which transfers heat when there are problematic minerals and gases such \nas hydrogen sulfide mixed in with the fluid.\nGeothermal heat pumps\nGeothermal heat pumps (GHPs) take advantage of the relatively stable moderate temperature \nconditions that occur within the first 300 meters of the surface to heat buildings in the winter and \ncool them in the summer. In that part of the lithosphere, rocks and groundwater occur at \ntemperatures between 5 and 30 °C. At shallower depths, where most GHPs are found, such as \nwithin 6 meters of Earth's surface, the temperature of the ground maintains a near-constant \ntemperature of 10 to 16 °C. Consequently, that heat can be used to help warm buildings during \nthe colder months of the year when the air temperature falls below that of the ground. Similarly, \nduring the warmer months of the year, warm air can be drawn from a building and circulated \nunderground, where it loses much of its heat and is returned.\n\n \nFig. 19. Residential heat pump operation for summer cooling and winter heating (Source: \nEncyclopedia Britannica)\nA GHP system is made up of a heat exchanger (a loop of pipes buried in the ground) and a \npump. The heat exchanger transfers heat energy between the ground and air at the surface by \nmeans of a fluid that circulates through the pipes; the fluid used is often water or a combination \nof water and antifreeze. During warmer months, heat from warm air is transferred to the heat \nexchanger and into the fluid. As it moves through the pipes, the heat is dispersed to the rocks, \nsoil, and groundwater. The pump is reversed during the colder months. Heat energy stored in the \nrelatively warm ground raises the temperature of the fluid. The fluid then transfers this energy to \nthe heat pump, which warms the air inside the building.\nGHPs have several advantages over more conventional heating and air-conditioning systems. \nThey are very efficient, using 25-50 percent less electricity than comparable conventional \nheating and cooling systems, and they produce less pollution. The reduction in energy use \nassociated with GHPs can translate into as much as a 44 percent decrease in greenhouse gas \nemissions compared with air-source heat pumps (which transfer heat between indoor and outdoor \nair). In addition, when compared with electric resistance heating systems (which convert \nelectricity to heat) coupled with standard air-conditioning systems, GHPs can produce up to 72 \npercent less greenhouse gas emissions.\nElectric power generation\nDepending upon the temperature and the fluid (steam) flow, geothermal energy can be used to \ngenerate electricity. Geothermal power plants can produce electricity in three ways. Despite their \ndifferences in design, all three control the behavior of steam and use it to drive electrical \ngenerators. Given that the excess water vapor at the end of each process is condensed and \nreturned to the ground, where it is reheated for later use, geothermal power is considered a form \nof renewable energy.\n \nFig. 20. Dry steam geothermal power generation (Source: Encyclopedia Britannica)\nSome geothermal power plants simply collect rising steam from the ground. In such \"dry steam\" \noperations, the heated water vapor is funneled directly into a turbine that drives an electrical \ngenerator. Other power plants, built around the flash steam and binary cycle designs, use a \nmixture of steam and heated water (\"wet steam\") extracted from the ground to start the electrical \ngeneration process.\n \nFig. 21. Flash steam geothermal power generation (Source: Encyclopedia Britannica)\n\n \nFig. 22. Binary-cycle geothermal power generation (Source: Encyclopedia Britannica)\nIn flash steam power plants, pressurized high-temperature water is drawn from beneath the \nsurface into containers at the surface, called flash tanks, where the sudden decrease in pressure \ncauses the liquid water to \"flash,\" or vaporize, into steam. The steam is then used to power the \nturbine-generator set. In contrast, binary-cycle power plants use steam driven off a secondary \nworking fluid (such as ammonia and hydrocarbons) contained within a closed loop of pipes to \npower the turbine-generator set. In this process, geothermally heated water is drawn up through a \ndifferent set of pipes, and much of the energy stored in the heated water is transferred to the \nworking fluid through a heat exchanger. The working fluid then vaporizes. After the vapor from \nthe working fluid passes through the turbine, it is recondensed and piped back to the heat \nexchanger.\nElectrical power usually requires water heated above 175 °C to be economical. In geothermal \nplants using the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), a special type of binary-cycle technology that \nutilizes lower-temperature heat sources (such as biomass combustion and industrial waste heat), \nwater temperatures as low as 85-90 °C may be used.\nExhaustion\nGeothermal resources can be exhausted if the rate of heat extraction exceeds the rate of \nnatural heat recharge. Normally, geothermal resources can be used for 20 to 30 years; \nhowever, the energy output may decrease with time, making continued development \nuneconomical. with proper management, geothermal resources can be sustainable for many \nyears, and they can even recover if use is suspended for a period of time.\nEconomic & environmental issues\nComparing the benefits of geothermal energy with other renewable energy sources, the main \nadvantage of geothermal energy is that its base load is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per \nweek, whereas solar and wind are available only about one-third of the time. In addition, the cost \nof geothermal energy varies between 5 and 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, which can be competitive \nwith other energy sources, such as coal. The main disadvantage of geothermal energy \ndevelopment is the high initial investment cost in constructing the facilities and infrastructure \nand the high risk of proving the resources. (Geothermal resources in low-permeability rocks are \noften found, and exploration activities often drill \"dry\" holes-that is, holes that produce steam \nin amounts too low to be exploited economically.) However, once the resource is proven, the \nannual cost of fuel (that is, hot water and steam) is low and tends not to escalate in price.\n \nFig. 23. Geothermal energy uses (Source: Geothermal Education Office, California, SUA)\nThe environmental effects of geothermal development and power generation include the changes \nin land use associated with exploration and plant construction, noise and sight pollution, the \ndischarge of water and gases, the production of foul odors, and soil subsidence.\nSituation in EU\nGeothermal represented 0.5 % of the global renewable electricity market in 2022, generating 0.2 \n% of electricity in the EU.\nIn a project called Geothermica, which involves specialists, analysts and financiers from 13 \ncountries, the EU throws in a budget of EUR 30 million for small and large projects using \ngeothermal energy for heating, cooling and electricity generation. Like the wind, the boiling \nwater from the ground would have the potential to contribute to the 'greening' of the air we \nbreathe. As in the case of any other energy source considered, for various social, economic and \nespecially political arguments, as 'savior', geothermal energy is still dressed in the in the garb of \nnon-polluting righteousness. But, in terms of geothermal water, the EU does not hold such \nsubstantial reserves as to witness a new gold rush, as it happened with wind energy.\n\n \nFig. 24. Geothermal energy uses function of temperature (Source: www. \ncrowd.thermalproject.com)\nThe few European states that fall into such a ranking are Iceland or Italy, with almost 1,000 MW, \nthe leader of the EU bloc in this respect. Germany also has a number of intentions to use this \ntype of energy, but for now at small scale, with existing units of less than 40 MW, while Portugal \nholds 30 MW in geothermal energy. The geothermal energy installed in the EU can supply about \n2 million homes.\nThe use of geothermal energy in Europe is expected to grow rapidly over the next decades, since \nthis energy resource is generally abundant, ubiquitous, versatile, low-carbon, and non-\nintermittent. The researchers from the above-mentioned project have expanded and adapted the \nintegrated assessment model TIAM-ECN to more adequately reflect geothermal energy \npotentials and to better represent the various sectors in which geothermal energy could possibly \nbe used. With the updated version of TIAM-ECN, they quantify how large the share of \ngeothermal energy in Europe could grow until 2050, and analyze how this expansion could be \nstimulated by climate policy and technological progress. They investigate geothermal energy's \ntwo main applications: power and heat production. For the former, an increase to around 100-\n210 TWh/year in 2050 can be expected, depending on assumptions regarding climate ambition \nand cost reductions for enhanced geothermal resource systems. For the latter, with applications in \nresidential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors, one can anticipate under the same \nassumptions a rise to about 880-1050 TWh/year in 2050. One can estimate that by the middle of \nthe century geothermal energy plants could contribute approximately 4-7% to European \nelectricity generation. A European geothermal energy investment market (supply plus demand \nside) possibly worth about 160-210 billion US$/year by mid-century can be foreseen.\n \nFig. 25. Share of energy from renewable resources in the EU Member States, 2020 target \n(Source: Eurostat)\nBIOMASS & BIOFUELS\nDefinition: Biofuel is considered any fuel that is derived from biomass-that is, plant or algae \nmaterial or animal waste. Since such feedstock material can be replenished readily, biofuel is \nconsidered to be a source of renewable energy, unlike fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal, and \nnatural gas. Biofuel is commonly advocated as a cost-effective and environmentally benign \nalternative to petroleum and other fossil fuels, particularly within the context of rising petroleum \nprices and increased concern over the contributions made by fossil fuels to global warming. \nMany critics express concerns about the scope of the expansion of certain biofuels because of the \neconomic and environmental costs associated with the refining process and the potential removal \nof vast areas of arable land from food production.\nOther definition is: \"Biofuels are biobased products, in solid, liquid, or gaseous forms. They are \nproduced from crops or natural products, such as wood, or agricultural residues, such as \nmolasses and bagasse.\" \nHighlights: IEA Bioenergy Task 39:\n*\tThe EU-27 supply of biofuels in 2020 was around 16 million Tons of Oil Equivalent \n(Mtoe), which accounted for 6.3% of the total transport fuel consumption in the EU. \nAbout 85% of biofuels supply came from primary production within the EU.\n*\tIn 2020, the overall EU production of biofuels was 20 billion liters per year, of which 15 \nbillion liters (about 13 Mtoe) biodiesel and 5 billion liters (about 3 Mtoe) bioethanol. \nMost biofuels are conventional biofuels produced from vegetable oil as rapeseed, sugar \nbeets and maize, but a growing amount of them is produced from feedstocks such as used \ncooking oil, reaching more than 4 Mtoe in 2020, representing around 25% of total biofuel \nconsumption. Of this, 1.2 Mtoe are advanced biofuels, produced from lignocellulosic \nfeedstocks, with a limited planned production up to 1.85 Mt/y.\n*\tAfter the Covid-19 period, the production of liquid biofuels for road transport remained \nalmost constant, but a rapid market uptake is expected in the coming years, in particular \nfor advanced biofuels as biomethane and aviation biofuels.\n*\tNew policy mechanisms have been promoted to stimulate the production of biofuels, in \nparticular the Fit-for-55 package revising the RED II and setting more ambitious targets \nfor GHG emissions reduction by 2030. The package also introduced specific targets for \nnon-biological fuels, aviation and maritime biofuels.\n*\tAs part of the RE Power EU plan the EC proposed in May 2022 to further increase the \nshare of energy from renewable sources in the gross final consumption of energy to 45% \nby 2030. RE Power EU is the action for substituting fossil fuels, reducing the dependence \non Russian fossil fuels and accelerating Europe's clean energy transition, to further \ndeployment of renewables.\n*\tRE Power EU has also set a goal to promote renewable gases such as hydrogen and \nbiomethane and in particular to increase biomethane production to 35 bcm (billion cubic \nmeters) by 2030 to replace natural gas imports.\n*\tAdvanced biofuels are expected to play an increasing role in transport: a sub-target for \nadvanced biofuels supplied to the transport sector was set at 0.2% in 2022; 1% in 2025 \nand 3.5% in 2030, integrating the addition of a double counting for these fuels. More \nambitions targets are currently revised, given the necessity for a higher greenhouse gas \nemission reduction from transport sector.\n*\tSeveral delegated acts are expected to be adopted by the European Commission: \ndelegated act setting the rules to determine the sustainability and eligibility of hydrogen \nand non-biological fuels (released in February 2023); delegated act setting the \nmethodology for bio-carbon in co-processing crude oil and bio-based feedstock; \ndelegated act updating the RED II for the feedstocks eligible for advanced biofuels \nproduction (2023).\n \nFig. 26.

(b) \nTechnologies involved for production of first, second, third, and fourth generations of biofuel. \nAdapted with permission from Dutta et al. (2014)\nFirst-generation biofuels (also denoted as \"conventional biofuels\") are made from food crops \ngrown on arable land. The crop's sugar, starch, or oil content is converted into biodiesel or \nethanol, using transesterification, or yeast fermentation. To avoid a \"food versus fuel\" dilemma, \nsecond-generation biofuels (also called advanced biofuels or sustainable biofuels) are made from \nwaste products. These are derived from agriculture and forestry activities such as rice straw, rice \nhusk, wood chips, and sawdust. \nThe feedstock used to make the fuels either grow on arable land but are byproducts of the main \ncrop, or they are grown on marginal land. Second-generation feedstocks also include straw, \nbagasse, perennial grasses, jatropha, waste vegetable oil, municipal solid waste and so forth. \n \nFig. 29. The production of biofuels from vegetable oils (c) Copyright CPL Press\n \nFig. 30. Biochemical routes to liquid biofuels (c) Copyright CPL Press\n\n \nFig. 31. Thermochemical routes to liquid biofuels (c) Copyright CPL Press\nEconomic and environmental considerations\nIn evaluating the economic benefits of biofuels, the energy required to produce them has to be \ntaken into account. For example, the process of growing corn to produce ethanol consumes fossil \nfuels in farming equipment, in fertilizer manufacturing, in corn transportation, and in ethanol \ndistillation. In this respect, ethanol made from corn represents a relatively small energy gain; the \nenergy gain from sugarcane is greater and that from cellulosic ethanol or algae biodiesel could be \neven greater.\nBiofuels also supply environmental benefits but, depending on how they are manufactured, can \nalso have serious environmental drawbacks. As a renewable energy source, plant-based biofuels \nin principle make little net contribution to global warming and climate change; the carbon \ndioxide (a major greenhouse gas) that enters the air during combustion will have been removed \nfrom the air earlier as growing plants engage in photosynthesis. Such a material is said to be \n\"carbon neutral.\" In practice, however, the industrial production of agricultural biofuels can \nresult in additional emissions of greenhouse gases that may offset the benefits of using a \nrenewable fuel. These emissions include carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels during \nthe production process and nitrous oxide from soil that has been treated with nitrogen fertilizer. \nIn this regard, cellulosic biomass is considered to be more beneficial.\nLand use is also a major factor in evaluating the benefits of biofuels. The use of regular \nfeedstock, such as corn and soybeans, as a primary component of first-generation biofuels \nsparked the \"food versus fuel\" debate. In diverting arable land and feedstock from the human \nfood chain, biofuel production can affect the economics of food price and availability. In \naddition, energy crops grown for biofuel can compete for the world's natural habitats. For \nexample, emphasis on ethanol derived from corn is shifting grasslands and brushlands to corn \nmonocultures, and emphasis on biodiesel is bringing down ancient tropical forests to make way \nfor oil palm plantations. Loss of natural habitat can change the hydrology, increase erosion, and \ngenerally reduce biodiversity of wildlife areas. The clearing of land can also result in the sudden \nrelease of a large amount of carbon dioxide as the plant matter that it contains is burned or \nallowed to decay.\nSome of the disadvantages of biofuels apply mainly to low-diversity biofuel sources-corn, \nsoybeans, sugarcane, oil palms-which are traditional agricultural crops. One alternative \ninvolves the use of highly diverse mixtures of species. Converting degraded agricultural land that \nis out of production to such high-diversity biofuel sources could increase wildlife area, reduce \nerosion, cleanse waterborne pollutants, store carbon dioxide from the air as carbon compounds in \nthe soil, and ultimately restore fertility to degraded lands. Such biofuels could be burned directly \nto generate electricity or converted to liquid fuels as technologies develop.\nOne distinctive promise of biofuels is that, in combination with an emerging technology called \ncarbon capture and storage, the process of producing and using biofuels may be capable of \nperpetually removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Under this vision, biofuel crops \nwould remove carbon dioxide from the air as they grow, and energy facilities would capture the \ncarbon dioxide given off as biofuels are burned to generate power. Captured carbon dioxide \ncould be sequestered (stored) in long-term repositories such as geologic formations beneath the \nland, in sediments of the deep ocean, or conceivably as solids such as carbonates. \nEU Regulations: Biofuels and biogas in co-processed fuels\nThe Commission adopted in June 2023 new rules establishing the share of biofuels and biogas in \nmixed fuels, co-processed using bio-based and fossil-based raw materials, and that can count \ntowards the Renewable Energy Directive target for renewables in transport. The Delegated \nRegulation (EU/2023/1640) was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 18 August 2023 \nand has been subject to public feedback, several consultations and scrutiny from the European \nParliament and the Council.\nUnder the Renewable Energy Directive, EU countries are obliged to ensure that the share of \nrenewable energy in the final consumption of energy in transport is at least 14% by 2030, \nincluding a minimum share of 3.5% of advanced biofuels.\nThey are also required to set out an obligation on fuel suppliers that ensures the achievement of \nthis target.\nSustainability criteria\nThe revised Renewable Energy Directive (EU/2023/2413) provides an overarching policy for the \npromotion and use of energy from renewable sources in the EU. It also reinforces the \nsustainability criteria of bioenergy through different provisions, including the negative direct \nimpact that the production of biofuels may have due to indirect land use change.\nWhile biofuels are important in helping the EU meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets, biofuel \nproduction typically takes place on cropland that was previously used for agriculture, to grow \nfood or feed. Since this agricultural production is necessary, biofuel production may lead to the \nextension of agricultural land into non-crop land, possibly including areas with high carbon \nstock, such as forests, wetlands and peatlands. This process is known as indirect land use change \n(ILUC). As it may cause the release of CO2 stored in trees and soil, ILUC poses a risk to the \ngreenhouse gas savings that result from increased production of biofuels.\nTo address the issue of ILUC, the revised directive introduces a new approach by setting limits \non high ILUC-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels with a significant expansion in land \nwith high carbon stock. These limits affect the amount of these fuels that EU countries can count \ntowards their national targets when calculating the overall national share of renewables and the \nshare of renewables in transport. EU countries will still be able to use (and import) fuels covered \nby these limits, but they will not be able to include these volumes when calculating the extent to \nwhich they have fulfilled their renewable targets. These limits impose a freeze equivalent to \n2019 levels for the period 2021-2023, which will gradually decrease from the end of 2023 to \nzero by 2030. The directive also introduces an exemption to these limits for biofuels, bioliquids \nand biomass fuels certified as low ILUC-risk.\nFor the implementation of this approach, as required by the directive, the Commission adopted \nthe Delegated Regulation on indirect land-use change (EU 2019/807), in which it lays down \nprovisions to determine the high ILUC-risk feedstock for which a significant expansion of the \nproduction area into land with high carbon stock is observed. It also sets out criteria to certify \nlow ILUC-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels.\nFurthermore, specific rules and methodological guidance for certification of low ILUC-risk \nbiofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels have been included in the Implementing Regulation on \nsustainability certification proposed by the Commission in line with Article 30(8) of the revised \ndirective. The Implementing Regulation received on a positive vote by the Committee on the \nsustainability of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels on 10 March 2022, and was published in \nthe Official Journal on 27 June 2022.\nQuality standards for biofuels\nWorking together with the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the EU aims to \ndevelop and improve the technical quality standards of biofuels and biofuel blends for vehicle \nengines. The practical work is carried out by CEN Technical Committee 19, consisting of experts \nfrom the automotive and fuel industries, biofuels producers, and other stakeholders.\nThe Commission may decide, by means of an implementing act, that reports submitted by EU \ncountries and by countries outside the EU contain accurate data for the purposes of measuring \nthe greenhouse gas emissions associated with the cultivation of biofuel and bioliquid feedstocks \ntypically produced in those areas.\nIn general, biofuels emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions when burned in an engine and are \ngenerally considered carbon-neutral fuels as the carbon emitted has been captured from the \natmosphere by the crops used in production. However, life-cycle assessments of biofuels have \nshown large emissions associated with the potential land-use change required to produce \nadditional biofuel feedstocks. Estimates about the climate impact from biofuels vary widely \nbased on the methodology and exact situation examined. Therefore, the climate change \nmitigation potential of biofuel varies considerably: in some scenarios emission levels are \ncomparable to fossil fuels, and in other scenarios the biofuel emissions result in negative \nemissions. \nTypes of biofuels\nSome long-exploited biofuels, such as wood, can be used directly as a raw material that is burned \nto produce heat. The heat, in turn, can be used to run generators in a power plant to produce \nelectricity. A number of existing power facilities burn grass, wood, or other kinds of biomass.\nLiquid biofuels are of particular interest because of the vast infrastructure already in place to use \nthem, especially for transportation. \nA. Liquid biofuels\na) The liquid biofuel in greatest production is ethanol (ethyl alcohol), which is made by \nfermenting starch or sugar. Unlike the \"first-generation\" ethanol biofuel produced from food \ncrops, \"second-generation\" cellulosic ethanol is derived from low-value biomass that possesses a \nhigh cellulose content, including wood chips, crop residues, and municipal waste. Cellulosic \nethanol is commonly made from sugarcane bagasse, a waste product from sugar processing, or \nfrom various grasses that can be cultivated on low-quality land. Given that the conversion rate is \nlower than with first-generation biofuels, cellulosic ethanol is dominantly used as a gasoline \nadditive.\nBiologically produced alcohols, most commonly ethanol, and less commonly propanol and \nbutanol, are produced by the action of microorganisms and enzymes through the fermentation of \nsugars or starches (easiest), or cellulose (which is more difficult).The IEA estimates that ethanol \nproduction used 20% of sugar supplies and 13% of corn supplies in 2021. \nEthanol fuel is the most common biofuel worldwide. Alcohol fuels are produced by fermentation \nof sugars derived from wheat, corn, sugar beets, sugar cane, molasses and any sugar or starch \nfrom which alcoholic beverages, can be made (such as potato and fruit waste, etc.). The ethanol \nproduction methods used are enzyme digestion (to release sugars from stored starches), \nfermentation of the sugars, distillation and drying. The distillation process requires significant \nenergy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable natural gas fossil fuel),but pellets, wood chips \nand also waste heat are more common in Europe. Waste steam fuels ethanol factory - where \nwaste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid. Corn-to-ethanol and other \nfood stocks has led to the development of cellulosic ethanol. \nOther bio alcohols\nMethanol is currently produced from natural gas, a non-renewable fossil fuel. In the future it is \nhoped to be produced from biomass as bio methanol. This is technically feasible, but the \nproduction is currently being postponed for concerns that the economic viability is still pending. \nThe methanol economy is an alternative to the hydrogen economy to be contrasted with today's \nhydrogen production from natural gas. \nButanol is formed by ABE fermentation (acetone, butanol, ethanol) and experimental \nmodifications of the process show potentially high net energy gains with biobutanol as the only \nliquid product. Biobutanol is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline, because \nit will produce more energy than ethanol and allegedly can be burned \"straight\" in existing \ngasoline engines (without modification to the engine or car). Escherichia coli strains have also \nbeen successfully engineered to produce butanol by modifying their amino acid metabolism. One \ndrawback to butanol production in E. coli remains the high cost of nutrient rich media, however, \nrecent work has demonstrated E. coli can produce butanol with minimal nutritional \nsupplementation. \nb) Biodiesel\nThe second most common liquid biofuel is biodiesel, which is made primarily from oily plants \n(such as the soybean or oil palm) and to a lesser extent from other oily sources (such as waste \ncooking fat from restaurant deep-frying). Biodiesel, which has found greatest acceptance in \nEurope, is used in diesel engines and usually blended with petroleum diesel fuel in various \npercentages. The use of algae and cyanobacteria as a source of \"third-generation\" biodiesel holds \npromise but has been difficult to develop economically. Some algal species contain up to 40 \npercent lipids by weight, which can be converted into biodiesel or synthetic petroleum. Some \nestimates state that algae and cyanobacteria could yield between 10 and 100 times more fuel per \nunit area than second-generation biofuels.\nBiodiesel is the most common biofuel in Europe. It is produced from oils or fats using \ntransesterification and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel. Chemically, it \nconsists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) esters (FAMEs). Feedstocks for biodiesel include \nanimal fats, vegetable oils, soy, rapeseed, jatropha, mahua, mustard, flax, sunflower, palm oil, \nhemp, field pennycress, Pongamia pinnata and algae. Pure biodiesel (B100, also known as \n\"neat\" biodiesel) currently reduces emissions with up to 60% compared to diesel. \nBiodiesel can be used in any diesel engine and modified equipment when mixed with mineral \ndiesel. It can also be used in its pure form (B100) in diesel engines, but some maintenance and \nperformance problems may then occur during wintertime utilization, since the fuel becomes \nsomewhat more viscous at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used. \nIn many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of \ngas stations. Biodiesel is also an oxygenated fuel, meaning it contains a reduced amount of \ncarbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel. This improves the combustion \nof biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon. However, using pure \nbiodiesel may increase NOx-emissions.\nBiodiesel is also safe to handle and transport because it is non-toxic and biodegradable, and has a \nhigh flash point of about 148°C, compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which has a flash point of \n52 C. \nIn France, biodiesel is incorporated at a rate of 8% in the fuel used by all French diesel vehicles. \nAvril Group produces under the brand Diester, a fifth of 11 million tons of biodiesel consumed \nannually by the European Union. It is the leading European producer of biodiesel. \nGreen diesel\nGreen diesel is produced through hydrocracking biological oil feedstocks, such as vegetable oils \nand animal fats. Hydrocracking is a refinery method that uses elevated temperatures and pressure \nin the presence of a catalyst to break down larger molecules, such as those found in vegetable \noils, into shorter hydrocarbon chains used in diesel engines. It may also be called renewable \ndiesel, hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO fuel) or hydrogen-derived renewable diesel. Unlike \nbiodiesel, green diesel has exactly the same chemical properties as petroleum-based diesel. It \ndoes not require new engines, pipelines or infrastructure to distribute and use, but has not been \nproduced at a cost that is competitive with petroleum. \nStraight vegetable oil\nStraight unmodified edible vegetable oil is generally not used as fuel, but lower-quality oil has \nbeen used for this purpose. Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel, or \n(more rarely) cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel. The IEA estimates that \nbiodiesel production used 17% of global vegetable oil supplies in 2021. \nAn aviation biofuel (also known as bio-jet fuel or bio-aviation fuel (BAF)) is a biofuel used to \npower aircraft and is said to be a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The International Air Transport \nAssociation (IATA) considers it a key element to reducing the carbon footprint within the \nenvironmental impact of aviation. Aviation biofuel could help decarbonize medium- and long-\nhaul air travel generating most emissions, and could extend the life of older aircraft types by \nlowering their carbon footprint. The jargon synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) refers to any \nnon-petroleum-based fuel designed to replace kerosene jet fuel, which are often, but not always, \nmade from biomass. \nAviation biofuel can be produced from plant or animal sources such as Jatropha, algae, tallows, \nwaste oils, palm oil, Babassu, and Camelina (bio-SPK); from solid biomass using pyrolysis \nprocessed with a Fischer-Tropsch process (FT-SPK); with an alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) process from \nwaste fermentation; or from synthetic biology through a solar reactor. Small piston engines can \nbe modified to burn ethanol. \nSustainable biofuels do not compete with food crops, prime agricultural land, natural forest or \nfresh water. Sustainable aviation fuel is certified as being sustainable by a third-party \norganization.\nB. Gaseous biofuels\nBiogas and biomethane\nOther biofuels include methane gas and biogas-which can be derived from the fermentation of \nbiomass in the absence of oxygen-and methanol, butanol, and dimethyl ether-which are in \ndevelopment.\nBiogas is a mixture composed primarily of methane and carbon dioxide produced by the process \nof anaerobic digestion of organic material by micro-organisms. Other trace components of this \nmixture include water vapor, hydrogen sulfide, siloxanes, hydrocarbons, ammonia, oxygen, \ncarbon monoxide, and nitrogen. It can be produced either from biodegradable waste materials or \nby the use of energy crops fed into anaerobic digesters to supplement gas yields. The solid \nbyproduct, digestate, can be used as a biofuel or a fertilizer. When CO2 and other impurities are \nremoved from biogas, it is called biomethane. \nBiogas can be recovered from mechanical biological treatment waste processing systems. \nLandfill gas, a less clean form of biogas, is produced in landfills through naturally occurring \nanaerobic digestion. If it escapes into the atmosphere, it acts as a greenhouse gas. \nFarmers can produce biogas from manure from their cattle by using anaerobic digesters. \nSyngas\nSyngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen and various hydrocarbons, is produced by \npartial combustion of biomass, that is, combustion with an amount of oxygen that is not \nsufficient to convert the biomass completely to carbon dioxide and water. Before partial \ncombustion, the biomass is dried, and sometimes pyrolyzed. The resulting gas mixture, syngas, is \nmore efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel; more of the energy contained in the \nfuel is extracted. \nSyngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines, turbines or high-temperature fuel \ncells. The wood gas generator, a wood-fueled gasification reactor, can be connected to an \ninternal combustion engine. \nSyngas can be used to produce methanol, dimethyl ether and hydrogen, or converted via the \nFischer-Tropsch process to produce a diesel substitute, or a mixture of alcohols that can be \nblended into gasoline. Gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than 700 C. \nLower-temperature gasification is desirable when co-producing biochar, but results in syngas \npolluted with tar. \n\nI.\tENERGY FROM SOLID WASTE BIOTRANSFORMATION (presented in the \nMODULE 3: INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY FOR CIRCULAR ECONOMY-\nBIOECONOMY)\nII.\tGREEN HYDROGEN\nFirst of all, it is useful to explain what it is the production of GREEN HYDROGEN. Green \nhydrogen (GH2 or GH2) is hydrogen produced by the electrolysis of water, using electricity \ngenerated from renewable sources. Hydrogen can be utilized as a safe and reliable fuel, but it \nmust be produced from a primary source of energy. It is considered desirable because, when you \nburn it, hydrogen produces water as a byproduct. No greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or air \npollutants are associated with the use of hydrogen. Hydrogen has the highest energy density \namongst today's most commonly used fuels, which include natural gas, gasoline, and diesel. \nHydrogen is much lighter than gasoline vapor and air, so it dissipates quickly when it is released. \nThis enables quick dispersion in the event of a leak. Since at room temperature hydrogen has a \nvery low density, hydrogen energy is typically measured by weight in kilograms instead of by \nvolume. Despite being a colorless gas, hydrogen has been assigned color codes that are used by \nthe energy industry to indicate the energy sources, production processes, and primary feedstocks \nused to produce hydrogen.\nThe following scheme can introduce the differences between GREY, BLUE and GREEN \nhydrogen:\n \nFig. 32. Grey versus Blue versus Green hydrogen\nThe scenario of net zero emissions in 2050 imposes a lot of energetic transformations and \nimportant orientation towards green hydrogen, as it is represented in the following 2 schemes:\n \n(a)\n \n(b)\nFig 33. (a) and (b) Conditions for EU to produce green hydrogen (Source: BloombergNEF)\nhttps://hydrogen.revolve.media/2022/features/hydrogen-outlook/\n \nFig. 34. Breakdown of hydrogen production technologies using various sources: today and \nprediction for the year 2050 (International Energy Agency Technical Report 2013)\nAs one can see at the worldwide level the predictions regarding hydrogen production \ntechnologies in 2050 is not optimistic: H2 by electrolysis or from biomass can represent not more \nthan 30 %, and the level of green hydrogen from water hydrolysis is not evaluated.\nHydrogen, being a clean energy carrier, concurrently decarbonizes the commercial, residential, \nindustrial, and transportation sectors. Although, at present hydrogen is being considered as the \nmain alternative to and replacement for fossil fuels, it is not a naturally occurring substance. \nInstead, it is found in chemical substances such as hydrocarbons and water that must undergo \nchemical transformation to produce hydrogen gas. The most widely utilized technique for \nlargescale hydrogen generation is the steam reforming of natural gas. Producing hydrogen by \nsteam reforming natural gas involves the utilization of fossil fuels at the production stage, where \ngreenhouse gases are emitted.\nIn order to speed up the transition to Net Zero, hydrogen must be obtained from a process like \nwater electrolysis (green hydrogen), which does not involve using fossil fuels. In spite of the fact \nthat many industries in EU and all over the world have already implemented hydrogen fuel \nsystems in its infancy, the production, storage, transportation, and utilization of hydrogen present \nissues that need to be addressed.\nHydrogen economy, synonymous with sustainable energy, refers to the situation where the \nwhole energy system of a country is solely based on hydrogen. It can also be defined as an \neconomy in which hydrogen is the primary energy carrier along with electricity. The \nrealization and development of hydrogen-based economies have been difficult and challenging \ntasks due to the substantial investments needed. Hydrogen has always had the potential to be \nsignificant, but the challenges of establishing hydrogen economies all over the world have \nhindered progress. This is mainly because the production, storage, transportation, distribution, \nand utilization sectors in the hydrogen economy all have challenges that need to be addressed \nwhile maintaining strategic policy support.\nHydrogen preparation & water electrolysis / splitting\nWater splitting seems to be the most viable process for large scale hydrogen production from \nnon-fossil natural resources at the moment. For the water splitting process, solar radiation is first \nconverted to electricity in a photovoltaic cell, after which the water electrolysis takes place in a \ndifferent cell. Water electrolysis is achieved using an electrolyzer device. The most commonly \nused electrolyzer device is the alkaline electrolyzer. This type of electrolyzer has a relatively low \ncapital cost compared to the other types of electrolyzers.\nAn alkaline electrolyzer uses a cell with an anode, cathode, and an electrolyte based on a solution \nof caustic salts. Energy is needed to break water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen, but this \nenergy is eventually recovered during the oxidation process to produce water. The energy needed \nto split the water to release hydrogen must be obtained from a non-fossil source such as hole-\nelectron pair excitement in a robust semiconductor by solar radiation. A sturdy semiconductor \nmaterial that can satisfy and withstand nature's competing requirements is to be used.\nExisting challenges for water electrolysis presently include low conversion efficiency, high \nelectric power costs, and high production costs. The ways of alleviating water electrolysis costs \nare by reducing the cost of electricity, reducing the cost of the electrolyte, or removing the \nmembrane (separator) to reduce ohmic losses. For the reduction of the cost of electricity, \nintermittent electricity generated from renewable sources such as hydropower and wind can be \nused. Nuclear energy offers more cost-effective electrolysis and thermolysis compared to other \nenergy sources.\nHydrogen can also be produced from biomass, which is a more environmentally friendly method \nthan generating hydrogen from fossil fuels. Large-scale hydrogen generation from biomass \ninvolves the steam reforming of bio-oils, steam gasification, pyrolysis, gasification, and the \ndecomposition of sugars using enzymes. There are numerous benefits to microbial hydrogen \nproduction. But since this technology is still in the lab, it cannot be quickly and widely used. The \nmain concerns for the mass production of hydrogen from biomass are determining if the site \nbeing used for producing hydrogen from biomass competes with the feedstock while also \naddressing the political aspects of this decision.\nHydrogen storage\nOnce hydrogen is produced, it must be stored. Depending on its intended use, hydrogen can be \nstored in the liquid state (e.g., cryogenic liquid dewars), the solid state (e.g., metal hydrides), or \nthe gaseous state (e.g., compressed hydrogen gas being stored in high-pressure gas tanks).\nUsing high pressure storage tanks for storing compressed hydrogen is the conventional approach \nfor the storage of hydrogen gas. Geological storage such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs, salt \ncaverns, and aquifers are currently being considered as the most the most cost-effective and \nviable options for storing large amounts of gaseous hydrogen.\nThe approach for storing liquid hydrogen can be done using the liquefaction technique. The \nmethod of hydrogen liquefaction comprises of compression, expansion, and cooling to convert \nhydrogen gas to liquid hydrogen. A dewar-type vessel will then be utilized to keep liquid \nhydrogen at a final temperature of -253.15 0C. Because a significant portion of the hydrogen's \nenergy content may be lost during liquefaction, storing hydrogen in liquid form entails high \nenergy expenses.\nStoring hydrogen in the solid form can be done by chemically bonding it to alloys in the form of \nmetal hydrides. Metallic alloys that absorb hydrogen are referred to as metal hydrides. Alloys can \nbe used as a storage mechanism due to their ability to absorb and release hydrogen. These metal \nhydrides can be categorized into three main groups: Ti-based alloys, Mg-based alloys, and \nLaNi5-based alloys. To resist the charge-discharge cycles, these metal hydride alloys must be \nthermally and structurally stable. Implementing metal hydride storage systems presents two key \nchallenges: a delay between initial heating and the release of the hydrogen gas, and insufficient \nheat to generate hydrogen from the hydride.\nChoosing the state or form for storing hydrogen strongly depends on the end-use energy \nconversion applications, with each storage option having its own pros and cons. Hydrogen being \nstored in the solid state on the other hand, is considered more efficient and safer than liquefaction \nand compression due to lower self-discharge, leak proof status, and higher charging efficiency \ncons.\nTransportation and distribution of hydrogen\nHigh-strength steel pipelines linking the storage and production points to the end-use points \nmake up the infrastructure for transporting and distributing hydrogen. Pipeline materials \nconstantly in contact with hydrogen easily get embrittled by hydrogen. This mechanism is \nreferred to as hydrogen embrittlement and can damage a wide range of materials, even the high-\nstrength steel pipelines currently being used for transporting and distributing hydrogen. In \nhydrogen embrittlement, lone hydrogen atoms first diffuse through the metal. Small quantities of \nhydrogen diffuse into the metal at higher temperatures, while diffusion is aided by a \nconcentration gradient at lower temperatures. While recombining in minuscule voids of the metal \nto form hydrogen molecules, hydrogen atoms create pressure in the cavity they are trapped in. \nThe pressure will build-up and eventually cause the metal to crack open. By adhering to the \nrecommended maintenance procedures and safety measures, unwanted losses and damages can \nbe easily avoided. Other transportation and distribution system components, including pressure \nreduction stations, pipe seals, and end-use components, must also be evaluated for suitability. \nAccording to a study conducted by the EU, natural gas can be blended with about 30% hydrogen \nwithout putting the general public's safety in jeopardy.\nFuture hydrogen transportation and distribution systems may resemble the natural gas pipelines \nthat are currently in use, but with new modifications like better duct materials to prevent \nhydrogen leakage, alternative working pressures, and higher flow rates to overcome gaseous \nhydrogen's lower energy content. It is envisaged in the hydrogen economy that from the \nproduction plants and storage units, liquid hydrogen will be transported and distributed to \nconsumers by means of supertankers, while gaseous hydrogen will be transported and distributed \nthrough underground pipelines. \nHydrogen use\nIn addition to hydrogen's usage in the chemical and oil and gas sectors, it can also be utilized in \ntransportation applications such as Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) and fuel cells. Hydrogen \nfuel cells have enormous potential in the transportation sector to improve the energy efficiency, \nsignificantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and ultimately eradicate the utilization of fossil \nfuels. Not only can fuel cells be used in trucks, buses, and cars, but they can also be used to \npower electric ships and replace diesel electric generators in locomotives. Hydrogen fuel cells \nare seen as the most promising power source for next generation automobiles in the hydrogen \neconomy and the only technology that has a chance of rivalling internal combustion engines. \n(ICEs). Hydrogen's primary selling point as a fuel is its intrinsic suitability for usage in fuel cells. \nA fuel cell vehicle powered by pure hydrogen is considered an emission-free vehicle because \nthe only byproduct is water. While maintaining comparable characteristics in terms of \npeak speed, range, and acceleration, fuel cell vehicles are considered way more efficient \nthan conventional vehicles.\nAdvancements in the hydrogen-powered vehicle technology are market-driven and must compete \nwith the conventional vehicles presently. The lack of refueling infrastructure, the low cost of \ngasoline, and the rise in vehicle costs are all impeding the advancement of hydrogen fuel cell \nvehicles. Another major concern is how to provide hydrogen to fuel cells. The options available \nare to either use the vehicle's fuel processor to produce hydrogen or store hydrogen on board of \nthe vehicles.\nHydrogen has a wide range of benefits. Hydrogen plays a significant role in decarbonizing global \nenergy sectors by presenting carbon-free fuel flexibility and also providing energy storage to the \ngrid. Hydrogen's versatility as a clean fuel, ability to power system services and provide heat can \nbe exploited to reduce the carbon intensity of multiple economic sectors. The deployment of \nhydrogen technologies could neutralize up to about one-fourth of global greenhouse gas \nemissions produced by industries and fossil fuels by the year 2030. Thousands of green jobs will \nalso be generated as global hydrogen economies develop. The skills applied in the fossil fuel \nindustries today are applicable to the green hydrogen industries. Also, the utilization of hydrogen \nas an alternative option to diesel and gasoline for transport will reduce price shocks that usually \noccur in the global fossil fuel supply chain. This is mainly because hydrogen can be produced \nfrom various renewable sources, so ultimately, its price will stabilize in the long run. \nFor the many benefits hydrogen provides, there are still a few cons and challenges that need to be \naddressed. Despite hydrogen being the most abundant element on earth, it does not exist on its \nown and needs to be extracted from either water using the water electrolysis technique or fossil \nfuels. Both of which demand a substantial amount of energy to be achieved. Given how highly \nflammable hydrogen is as a fuel, there are legitimate safety concerns about its widespread \nutilization.\nBased on the goal of hydrogen economies, the benefits of hydrogen far outweigh the cons. \nHydrogen has a great potential to become the ideal solution for the future of our energy \nrequirements, but this will require massive investments and political decisions. \nHydrogen offers a major potential to solve the energy landscape's biggest challenge, which is to \ndecarbonize heat. Ongoing research shows that hydrogen is the leading choice for decarbonizing \nheat without jeopardizing the safety of the general public.\nAn open-minded vision for the time being, but optimistic and really interesting for the \nfuture is to link preparation of Hydrogen by circular economy / bioeconomy technologies \nwith use of this gas as renewable fuel in a decarbonated system creating the already defined \nHydrogen economy, as it is represented in the following presentation. Linking water \nindustries (WI) and circular economy (CRE) perspectives are crucial to green hydrogen \nproduction (HP).\nThus, it is essential to manage the water, and wastewater resources following reduce, reuse, \nrecycle, reclaim, recover, and restore (6Rs) strategies of CRE. Establishing a CRE-based, self-\nenergy-generating WI can be a plausible solution for the future energy crisis and sustainable \nresources management.\n \nFig. 35. Connection between circular economy to produce TREATED WATER to be used further \non to generate GREENHYDROGEN (M. M. Kabir et al, Desalinization, 554, 116448, 1-48, \n2023)\n\n \nFig. 36. A flow diagram of linear and circular economy. (M. M. Kabir et al, Desalinization, 554, \n116448, 1-48, 2023)\nThere are still numerous obstacles and limitations that currently limit the potential of hydrogen \nas a fuel source to serve as a significant alternative to FFs now, such as large-scale hydrogen \nproduction cost, infrastructure investments, bulk storage, transport, and distribution, safety \nconsiderations, the absence of an existing value chain, and the requirement for international \nstandards and so on.\nConsidering the environmental pollution, Global warming issues, and future energy security, a \ntwo-fold revolutionary energy transition is immediately necessary. The earliest movement can be \nthe energy revolution: the steady and intensive transition from FF-based primary energy to \nsustainable and renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and water. \nThe subsequent phase would be the development of a sustainable hydrogen economy based on \nthe extensive usage of hydrogen as a green secondary energy carrier.\n1. The CRE does not concentrate on WI at a large-scale, also the applications, scopes, \nopportunities, limitations, and challenges of CRE implementation in water industries are still \nunexplored. Thus, identification and the potential implications of CRE in WI are essential for \nsustainable water resources management and resource recovery.\n2. Compared with the overall production method, the most environmentally friendly HP offers \nphotonic energy, and the highest efficiency offers thermal energy.\n3. Considering feed sources PEM (proton exchange membrane electrolyze) is the most suitable \ntechnology for HP in pure water, whereas MECs (microbial electrolysis cells) are the most \nappropriate technology for HP in wastewater. If we consider seawater as a feed source ED \n(electrodialysis) and RED (reverse electrodialysis) are the most competitive technologies for \nsimultaneous desalination and HP. Although, all these HP technologies are in their R& D stage.\n4. An analysis by the IEA found that the HP costs for green hydrogen ($2.5-5/kg), blue \nhydrogen ($1.50-3.50/kg), and grey hydrogen are all roughly $1.50/kg (Yue et al., 2021). The \ncost of HP\ntechnologies like EL (electrolysis), RED, and PECM (photo-electrochemical method) must be \nreduced to make hydrogen a viable fuel source for everyone.\n5. Case studies analysis in HP technologies and WI suggested European countries were the \ndominant hydrogen producers having 62.69 % of active projects. Germany had the highest \nnumber of active hydrogen production case studies recorded to be 50. \n6. The major challenge for developing a hydrogen economy is scaling up HP, and the transition \nfrom carbon-intensive to low carbon HP. Costs for green HP are still too high to be competitive \nwith other energy sources economically. The hydrogen price per kg should be approximately \n$1.5 for HP to be profitable. The need for ultrapure water poses one of the biggest obstacles \nsince it takes 9 L of water to produce 1 kg of hydrogen gas, which could trigger a water shortage \nin the future Hydrogen Economy (HE).\nThe future perspectives and research directions of green hydrogen production in WI for CRE \nframework are recommended as follows:\n? Establishment of a CRE-based, self-hydrogen energy-generating WI can be a plausible \nsolution for the future energy crisis and sustainable resources management. Since, one of the \nsignificant requirements of water electrolysis is the need for highly pure water feeds. Before \nfurther proceeding to develop a HE by 2030, the feasibility study of pure water requirement is \nhighly recommended.\n? It was estimated that 21 billion m3 of pure fresh water would be required to meet the ambitious \ndemand for HE by 2030.\nAccessible freshwater makes up just <1 % of the planet's water. It is best to avoid burdening \nfreshwater usage, especially in areas where drinking water is difficult to attain. Almost all the \nremaining 99 %, or about 1.4 billion km3, is seawater, which can be purified through desalination \nprocesses before being used as an electrolysis feedstock by electrodialysis or reverse osmosis \ntechniques.\n? Special consideration should be focused on wastewater to hydrogen production because it was \nestimated that 359 billion m3 of wastewater is produced each year and 785 million people lack \naccess to clean drinking water. Simultaneous WW treatment, resource recovery (Nitrogen, \npotassium and phosphorus) and hydrogen production could be a feasible option to clean green \nhydrogen production for a better HE without burdening the fresh water.\n? Green hydrogen cost could be one of the most significant obstacles to proceed with the HE, \nhence measures should be taken to maintain the hydrogen cost within 1-1.5 $/kg hydrogen to \ncompete with the alternative FFs-based energy.\n? Research on developing cost-effective catalysts and inexpensive membrane materials for PEM \nelectrolysis for HP are needed from PW (pure water), whereas MECs needs simple cell design, \nhigh membranes stability and minimal operational costs.\n? Hydrogen storage and safety issues also be needed to consider.\nResearch and development should be focused on development of low-cost hydrogen storage \nmaterials. In order to minimize possible hazards and risks of hydrogen, health and environmental \nsafety guidelines should be followed strictly.\n? International standards and regulations on the growth of worldwide H2 market and \ndevelopment of a proper hydrogen supply chain system would be necessary for the future HE.\n\n\n \n\nFig. 37.

It is be presented in the Circular Economy Action Plan of the European Green \ndeal.\n\nI.\tCIRCULAR ECONOMY\n1.\tDEFINITION\n \nFig. 1. Concept of circular economy (M. Geissdoerfer et al., 2020. Circular business models: A \nreview. Journal of Cleaner Production, article 123741)\n\nThe European Parliament defines circular economy (CE) as \"a model of production and \nconsumption that involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling \nexisting materials and products as long as possible. In this way, the life cycle of products is \nextended.\"\nIn practice, it implies reducing waste to a minimum. When a product reaches the end of its life, \nits materials are kept within the economy wherever possible thanks to recycling. These can be \nproductively used again and again, thereby creating further value.\nBy comparison in a linear economy, natural resources are turned into products that are \nultimately destined to become waste because of the way they have been designed and \nmanufactured. This process is often summarized as \"take, make, waste.\" By contrast, a circular \neconomy aims to transition from a 'take-make-waste' approach to a more restorative and \nregenerative system. It employs reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing and \nrecycling, meaning consumerism-altering concepts and actions to create a closed-loop \nsystem, reducing the use of resource inputs and the creation of waste, pollution, and carbon \nemissions. The circular economy aims to keep products, materials, equipment, and infrastructure \nin use for longer, thus improving the productivity of these resources. Waste materials and energy \nshould become input for other processes through waste valorization: either as a component for \nanother industrial process or as regenerative resources for nature (e.g., compost). The Ellen \nMacArthur Foundation (EMF) defines the circular economy as an industrial economy that \nis restorative or regenerative by value and design. \nA comprehensive definition could be: \"Circular economy is an economic system that targets zero \nwaste and pollution throughout materials lifecycles, from environment extraction to industrial \ntransformation, and final consumers, applying to all involved ecosystems. Upon its lifetime end, \nmaterials return to either an industrial process or, in the case of a treated organic residual, safely \nback to the environment as in a natural regenerating cycle. It operates by creating value at the \nmacro, meso, and micro levels and exploiting to the fullest the sustainability nested concept. \nUsed energy sources are clean and renewable. Resource use and consumption are efficient. \nGovernment agencies and responsible consumers play an active role in ensuring the correct \nsystem long-term operation. (G. C. Nobre et al., 2021-09-10, \"The quest for a circular economy \nfinal definition: A scientific perspective\". Journal of Cleaner Production. 314, 127973.)\n \nFig. 2. Difference between the circular economy and the linear economy. (Catherine Weetman-\nOwn work, CC BY-SA 4.0 Link, 2016)\nMay be the most clearly explained: a circular economy reduces material use, redesigns materials, \nproducts and services to be less resources intensive, and recapture waste as a resource to \nmanufacture new materials, products and energy.\n2.\tCIRCULAR ECONOMY AND SUSTAINABILITY\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted by all United Nations Member \nStates in 2015, providing a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, \nnow and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which \nare an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. \nThey recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies \nthat improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth - all while \ntackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.\nThe circular economy has the potential to contribute significantly to the sustainable development \ngoals (SDGs) set by the United Nations (UN). The Ellen MacArthur Foundation states that \"the \ncircular economy offers a powerful vision for a future in which economic growth is decoupled \nfrom resource constraints and negative environmental impacts\" (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, \nn.d.). \nOne of the critical ways the circular economy can contribute to the SDGs is by reducing waste \nand pollution. According to the European Environment Agency, \"the circular economy aims to \nminimize the environmental impacts of economic activities by closing the loop on resource use. \nIt seeks to keep products, components and materials at their highest utility and value at all times, \nthereby eliminating the generation of waste and minimizing the use of natural resources\" \n(European Environment Agency, 2018). By reusing and recycling resources, the circular \neconomy helps reduce the amount of waste generated and the amount of pollution released into \nthe environment (Ghisellini et al., 2017). This can positively impact the goal of ensuring \nsustainable cities and communities and the pursuit of responsible consumption and production \n(SDG 11 and 12). \nAmong the successful initiatives attempting to reduce waste and pollution through the circular \neconomy is the city of Malmö's \"Malmö Miljöbyrån\" program. Launched in 2002, this program \naims to reduce the city's environmental impact by implementing various measures, including \nrecycling, composting, and reuse (City of Malmö, n.d.). As part of this program, the city has \nestablished a network of recycling stations, composting facilities, and a range of educational and \noutreach programs to promote the circular economy. In addition, the city has implemented a \nrange of circular procurement policies, including using life cycle assessment tools to evaluate the \nenvironmental impact of products and services (City of Malmö, n.d.). \nBesides reducing waste and pollution, the circular economy can promote economic growth and \ndevelopment. According to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, \"the \ncircular economy can drive innovation, create new business opportunities and jobs, and \ncontribute to the competitiveness of companies and regions. It can also enhance resource \nproductivity, reduce costs and improve resilience\" (World Business Council for Sustainable \nDevelopment, 2015). By creating new business opportunities and jobs, the circular economy can \ncontribute to the goal of decent work and economic growth (SDG 8). It can also promote \ninnovation and technological development, supporting industry's plan, innovation, and \ninfrastructure (SDG 9). For example, the circular economy can support the development of small \nand medium enterprises, which can help to build more inclusive and diverse economic systems \n(Ghisellini et al., 2017). \nA successful example of a circular economy's economic benefits is the circular textile industry in \nthe Netherlands. According to the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, \"the \ncircular textile industry in the Netherlands is a fast-growing sector, which generates a turnover of \nmore than 1 billion per year and employs around 15,000 people\" (Ministry of Infrastructure and \nWater Management, n.d.). This industry has developed a range of innovative business models, \nincluding circular design, production and consumption, which have helped create new economic \nopportunities and jobs and reduce waste and pollution (Ministry of Infrastructure and Water \nManagement, n.d.). \nIn addition to promoting economic growth and development and resource efficiency, the circular \neconomy can also support the goal of sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11). The city of \nSan Francisco's \"Zero Waste\" program\", launched in 2002, aims to divert all of the city's solid \nwaste from landfill and incineration by 2020, through the implementation of a range of measures, \nincluding recycling, composting, and reuse (City and County of San Francisco, n.d.). As of 2019, \nthe city had achieved an 82% waste diversion rate, up from just 52% in 2002, resulting in \nsignificant reductions in waste and pollution (City and County of San Francisco, 2019). The \nsuccess of the Zero Waste program demonstrates the significant role that local governments can \nplay in promoting the circular economy and supporting the achievement of the SDGs. \nThe circular economy can also contribute to resource efficiency and the use of renewable \nresources. According to the United Nations Environment Program, \"a circular economy can \nincrease resource productivity and decrease the demand for virgin resources, as well as lower \ngreenhouse gas emissions and improve energy security. This can also help reduce economies' \nvulnerability to resource price fluctuations and supply risks\" (United Nations Environment \nProgram, 2017). By using resources more efficiently, the circular economy can help reduce the \ndemand for non-renewable resources and promote renewable resources (Ghisellini et al., 2017). \nThis can support the goal of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy for all \n(SDG 7) and the goal of climate action (SDG 13). \nIn terms of resource efficiency, one example of the circular economy's benefits is the \"Cradle to \nCradle\" design approach developed by the German company MBDC. This approach is based on \ncircular economy principles and aims to design products that can be continually reused and \nrecycled rather than disposed of at the end of their life (MBDC, n.d.). According to MBDC, the \nCradle-to-Cradle design approach has successfully reduced non-renewable resources and \npromoted renewable resources while reducing waste and pollution. \nMoreover, it is imperative to consider the potential impact of the circular economy on equity and \ninclusion. While the circular economy has the potential to bring significant benefits, including \neconomic growth and development, it is crucial to ensure that these benefits are shared equitably \n(Ghisellini et al., 2017). As the United Nations Development Program notes, \"achieving the \nSDGs requires the active participation and empowerment of all stakeholders, including \nmarginalized and disadvantaged groups, to ensure that no one is left behind\". This may require \ntargeted efforts to support the participation of marginalized and disadvantaged groups in the \ncircular economy, such as through training and capacity-building programs. Additionally, \nmarginalized and disadvantaged groups must not be negatively impacted by the transition to a \ncircular economy. \nAmong the circular economy initiatives that emphasize equity and inclusion is the \"Circular \nEconomy for All\" initiative, launched by the European Commission in 2019. This initiative aims \nto ensure that the benefits of the circular economy are shared equitably and to support the \nparticipation of marginalized and disadvantaged groups in the circular economy (European \nCommission, 2019). As part of this initiative, the European Commission has developed a range \nof measures to promote the inclusion of marginalized and disadvantaged groups in the circular \neconomy, including the development of training and capacity-building programs, the \nestablishment of a circular economy stakeholder platform to promote dialogue and cooperation \nbetween different stakeholders, and the development of a circular economy finance support \nplatform to support the financing of circular projects. \nThe role of local governments in promoting the circular economy is crucial. According to the \nEuropean Committee of the Regions, \"local and regional governments play a key role in driving \nthe transition towards a circular economy, as they are responsible for implementing the majority \nof environmental and waste policies, as well as investing in infrastructure and providing public \nservices\" (European Committee of the Regions, 2018). Local governments can take many steps \nto promote the circular economy. This includes implementing circular procurement policies, \nsupporting the development of circular business models, and investing in infrastructure for waste \ncollection and treatment. \nAn example of the role local governments plays in promoting circular economies is the city of \nGothenburg's \"Circular Gothenburg\" initiative. Launched in 2017, this initiative aims to \ntransform Gothenburg into a circular city by 2030 by implementing various measures, including \nrecycling, composting, and reuse (City of Gothenburg, n.d.). As part of this initiative, the city has \nestablished a range of circular procurement policies, including using life cycle assessment tools \nto evaluate the environmental impact of products and services (City of Gothenburg, n.d.). In \naddition, the city has established a circular economy innovation hub, which supports businesses \nand organizations developing circular solutions. \nAnother example of the role of local governments in promoting the circular economy is the city \nof Aarhus's \"Aarhus, the Sustainable City\" initiative, which aims to make Aarhus a \"fully \nsustainable city\" by 2030 (City of Aarhus, n.d.). As part of this initiative, the city has \nimplemented a number of measures to promote the circular economy, including the development \nof circular procurement guidelines for public authorities, the establishment of a circular economy \ninnovation hub, and the implementation of a \"repair cafe\" program, which provides support for \nthe repair of broken or damaged items (City of Aarhus, n.d.). The success of these initiatives \ndemonstrates the potential for local governments to play a leading role in the transition to a \ncircular economy. \nDenmark is a leader in the transition to a circular economy, with a range of initiatives at the \nnational and local level to promote the circular economy and support the achievement of the \nSDGs. The Danish Ministry of the Environment's \"Circular Denmark\" initiative, launched in \n2016, aims to transform Denmark into a fully circular economy by 2050 (Danish Ministry of the \nEnvironment, n.d.). As part of this initiative, the ministry has developed a range of measures to \npromote the circular economy, including the establishment of a circular economy secretariat to \nsupport the implementation of circular economy policies, the development of circular \nprocurement guidelines for public authorities, and the implementation of a \"circular public \nsector\" program, which aims to stimulate the demand for circular products and services in the \npublic sector (Danish Ministry of the Environment, n.d.). \n \nFig. 3. The circular economy model (Source: European Parliament research Service)\n\nMany tools and resources are available to help local governments implement circular economy \nstrategies. The European Union's Resource Efficiency Support Centers provide support and \nguidance to local and regional authorities in developing and implementing circular economy \nstrategies (European Commission, n.d.). The Ellen MacArthur Foundation's Circularity Index is \na tool that measures the circularity of economies at the regional and national levels and provides \nrecommendations for improving circularity (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, n.d.). In addition, the \nWorld Business Council for Sustainable Development's Circularity Index for Cities is a tool that \nhelps cities assess their circularity and identify opportunities for improvement (World Business \nCouncil for Sustainable Development, n.d.). \nIt is to underline the need of assessing the ethical implications of resource use and waste and \nexamining the values and principles that should guide the transition to a circular economy. This \ncould include the principles of climate justice, which recognize the disproportionate impact of \nclimate change on marginalized and disadvantaged communities, and call for a just and equitable \ntransition to a low-carbon economy (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \n2018).\n3.\tBENEFITS OF SWITCHING TO A CIRCULAR ECONOMY\nTo protect the environment\nReusing and recycling products would slow down the use of natural resources, reduce landscape \nand habitat disruption and help to limit biodiversity loss.\nAnother benefit from the circular economy is a reduction in total annual greenhouse gas \nemissions. According to the European Environment Agency, industrial processes and product use \nare responsible for 9.10% of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU, while the management of \nwaste accounts for 3.32%.\nCreating more efficient and sustainable products from the start would help to reduce energy and \nresource consumption, as it is estimated that more than 80% of a product's environmental impact \nis determined during the design phase.\nA shift to more reliable products that can be reused, upgraded and repaired would reduce the \namount of waste. Packaging is a growing issue and, on average, the average European generates \nnearly 180 kilos of packaging waste per year. The aim is to tackle excessive packaging and \nimprove its design to promote reuse and recycling.\nReduce raw material dependence\nThe world's population is growing and with it the demand for raw materials. However, the \nsupply of crucial raw materials is limited.\nFinite supplies also mean some EU countries are dependent on other countries for their raw \nmaterials. According to Eurostat, the EU imports about half of the raw materials it consumes.\nThe total value of trade (import plus exports) of raw materials between the EU and the rest of the \nworld has almost tripled since 2002, with exports growing faster than imports. Regardless, the \nEU still imports more than it exports. In 2021, this resulted in a trade deficit of 35.5 billion.\nRecycling raw materials mitigates the risks associated with supply, such as price volatility, \navailability and import dependency.\nThis especially applies to critical raw materials, needed for the production of technologies that \nare crucial for achieving climate goals, such as batteries and electric engines.\nCreate jobs and save consumers money\nMoving towards a more circular economy could increase competitiveness, stimulate innovation, \nboost economic growth and create jobs (700,000 jobs in the EU alone by 2030). \nRedesigning materials and products for circular use would also boost innovation across different \nsectors of the economy.\nConsumers will be provided with more durable and innovative products that will increase the \nquality of life and save them money in the long term.\n4.\tCIRCULAR ECONOMY ACTION PLAN OF THE EUROPEAN GREEN DEAL \n(2020)\na)\tContext\nYet by 2050, the world will be consuming as if there were three planets Earth. Global \nconsumption of materials such as biomass, fossil fuels, metals and minerals are expected to \ndouble in the next forty years, while annual waste generation is projected to increase by 70% by \n2050.\nSo, it is more than necessary a regenerative growth model that gives back to the planet \nmore than it takes, advance towards keeping its resource consumption within planetary \nboundaries, and therefore strive to reduce its consumption footprint and double its circular \nmaterial use rate in the coming decade.\nCircular Economy Action Plan is a product policy framework that will make sustainable \nproducts, services and business models the norm and transform consumption patterns so \nthat no waste is produced in the first place. This sustainable product policy framework has \nas central objectives to reduce waste and ensure that the EU has a well-functioning internal \nmarket for high quality secondary raw materials. The capacity of the EU to take \nresponsibility for its waste will be also strengthened.\n\nb). Main needed actions:\nI. Designing sustainable products\nIn order to make products fit for a climate-neutral, resource-efficient and circular economy, \nreduce waste and ensure that the performance of front-runners in sustainability progressively \nbecomes the norm, the Commission will propose a sustainable product policy legislative \ninitiative.\nThe core of this legislative initiative will be to widen the Eco design Directive beyond energy-\nrelated products so as to make the Eco design framework applicable to the broadest possible \nrange of products and make it deliver on circularity.\nAs part of this legislative initiative, and, where appropriate, through complementary legislative \nproposals, the Commission will consider establishing sustainability principles and other \nappropriate ways to regulate the following aspects:\n* improving product durability, reusability, upgradability and reparability,\n*addressing the presence of hazardous chemicals in products, and increasing their energy and \nresource efficiency;\n* increasing recycled content in products, while ensuring their performance and safety;\n* enabling remanufacturing and high-quality recycling;\n* reducing carbon and environmental footprints;\n* restricting single-use and countering premature obsolescence;\n* introducing a ban on the destruction of unsold durable goods;\n* incentivizing product-as-a-service or other models where producers keep the ownership of \nthe product or the responsibility for its performance throughout its lifecycle;\n* mobilizing the potential of digitalization of product information, including solutions such as \ndigital passports, tagging and watermarks;\n* rewarding products based on their different sustainability performance, including by linking \nhigh performance levels to incentives.\nPriority will be given to addressing product groups identified in the context of the value \nchains featuring in this Action Plan, such as electronics, ICT and textiles but also furniture \nand high impact intermediary products such as steel, cement and chemicals. Further product \ngroups will be identified based on their environmental impact and circularity potential.\nThe Commission will also increase the effectiveness of the current Eco design framework for \nenergy-related products.\nThe review of the Eco design Directive as well as further work on specific product groups, under \nthe Eco design framework or in the context of other instruments, will build, where appropriate, \non criteria and rules established under the EU Ecolabel Regulation, the Product Environmental \nFootprint approach and the EU GPP criteria. \nFurthermore, to support the effective and efficient application of the new sustainable product \nframework, the Commission will:\n* establish a common European Dataspace for Smart Circular Applications with data on \nvalue chains and product information.\nII. Empowering consumers and public buyers\nThe Commission will propose a revision of EU consumer law to ensure that consumers receive \ntrustworthy and relevant information on products at the point of sale, including on their \nlifespan and on the availability of repair services, spare parts and repair manuals.\nIII. Circularity in production processes\nThe Commission will enable greater circularity in industry by:\n* assessing options for further promoting circularity in industrial processes in the context of the \nreview of the Industrial Emissions Directive, including the integration of circular economy \npractices in upcoming Best Available Techniques.\n* facilitating industrial symbiosis by developing an industry-led reporting and certification \nsystem, and enabling the implementation of industrial symbiosis;\n* supporting the sustainable and circular bio-based sector through the implementation of the \nBioeconomy Action Plan;\n* promoting the use of digital technologies for tracking, tracing and mapping of resources;\n* promoting the uptake of green technologies through a system of solid verification by \nregistering the EU Environmental Technology Verification scheme as an EU certification \nmark.\n\nc). Key products value chains\nI. Electronics and ICT \nII. Batteries and vehicles\nIII. Packaging\n*reducing (over)packaging and packaging waste, including by setting targets and other waste \nprevention measures;\n* driving design for re-use and recyclability of packaging,\nIV. Plastics\n* The EU Strategy for Plastics in the Circular Economy with measures to reduce plastic litter \nsourcing, labelling and use of bio-based plastics, based on assessing where the use of bio-\nbased feedstock results in genuine environmental benefits, going beyond reduction in using fossil \nresources;\n* use of biodegradable or compostable plastics.\nV. Textiles: boosting the sorting, re-use and recycling of textiles, including through \ninnovation.\nVI. Construction and buildings \nIt is proposed the Construction Product Regulation, including the possible introduction of \nrecycled content requirements for certain construction products, taking into account their \nsafety and functionality.\nVII. Food, water and nutrients boosting the sustainability of renewable bio-based materials, \nincluding through actions following the Bioeconomy Strategy and Action Plan.\nThere are proposals for a new Water Reuse Regulation and directives on wastewater treatment \nand sewage sludge.\n\nd)\tOther topics\n1.Enhancing circularity in a toxic-free environment by developing methodologies to \nminimize the presence of substances that pose problems to health or the environment in \nrecycled materials and articles made thereof;\n2. Creating a well-functioning EU market for secondary raw materials\n3. The proposed European Urban Initiative, the Intelligent Cities Challenge Initiative, and \nthe Circular Cities and Regions Initiative will provide key assistance to cities. Circular \neconomy will be among the priority areas of the Green City Accord.\n4. Driving the transition through research, innovation and digitalization\n\n \nFig. 4. The international dimension of the EU' Circular Economy Action Plan (Source: SPBL \nNetherlands)\n5.\tCIRCULAR BUSINESS MODELS (BM)\nBusiness model innovation is \"the conceptualization and implementation of new business models \nthat can comprise the development of entirely new business models, the diversification into \nadditional business models, the acquisition of new business models, or the transformation from \none business model to another\". The transformation can affect the entire BM or individual or a \ncombination of its value proposition, value creation and deliver, and value capture elements, the \ninterrelations between the elements, and the value network.\" (M. Geissdoerfer et al., 2020. \nCircular business models: A review. Journal of Cleaner Production, article 123741)\n\n\n \nFig. 5. Circular business model strategies (M. Geissdoerfer et al., 2020. Circular business \nmodels: A review. Journal of Cleaner Production, article 123741)\nThe four different types of circular business model innovation identified:\n1) Circular business model transformation describes the modification of an existing business \nmodel. While the initial business model can be either both conventional or circular the resulting \nbusiness model incorporates circular economy strategies.\n2) Circular start-ups refer to the creation of new business models that incorporate circular \neconomy strategies (i.e. cycling, extending, intensifying, and/or dematerializing resource loops) \noutside of an existing company - with their own brand, employees and resources - although they \ncan be supported by non-independent institutions, such as incubators or accelerators.\n3) Circular business model diversification describes the development of new business models \nthat incorporate circular economy strategies from within an existing organization by using their \nresources and network. The current business model of the parent organization stays in place and \nthe new business models are either integrated into the organization as new businesses or spun-off \nas subsidiaries. This also includes joint business model innovation projects with other \norganizations.\n4) Circular business model acquisition describes merger and acquisition (M&A) activities that \ntarget business models that incorporate circular economy strategies. It comprises the \nidentification, acquisition, and integration of new circular business models. The extent of \nintegration can vary.\nOrganizations can also combine different strategies, for example, support start-ups with an \nincubator program and acquire successful participates for their business model portfolio, while \nalso diversifying their portfolio with the outputs of an internal business building unit. They could \nalso divest from their core business towards this new portfolio or leverage acquisitions to \nintroduce circular economy capabilities to transform their core business model.\n\n\n \n\nFig. 6. Four types of circular business model innovation, (M. Geissdoerfer et al., 2020. Circular \nbusiness models: A review. Journal of Cleaner Production, article 123741)\n\nOf these strategies, the 'transformation' might have the highest potential impact, especially, if it \nreplaces an existing linear model with a circular one.\nStrategic alliances could also be of interest, because of the important role of ecosystem \npartnerships. Alliances can be an enabler for the different strategies, for example in the context \nof circular business model transformation, beverage companies in Denmark have teamed up with \nmunicipalities to create a coordination entity to manage the return systems for packaging \nrecycling.\n\n\n\n6.\tCIRCULAR ECONOMY IMPLEMENTATION IN THE EU\n\n\n \nFig. 7. Circular economy initiatives in the European Union (P. Mhatre et al., Sustainable \nProduction and Consumption 26 (2021) 187-202)\n\nMain conclusions: The analysis points to the fact that recycling is the most commonly used CE \nstrategy. Additionally, technical nutrients are looped more as compared to biological ones. Most \nof the CE initiatives have been implemented at a macro level, i.e. in cities or regions or nation-\nwide. The penetration of CE has been varied in various industries. While waste-management, \nelectrical and electronic equipment and construction industries are rapidly adopting the CE \nprinciples, industries like mining and quarrying, health equipment and entertainment and \nrecreation have had a slow approach towards CE.\n\nII.\tCIRCULAR BIOECONOMY\n\n1.\tBIO-BASED ECONOMY / BIOECONOMY\nThe bioeconomy means using renewable biological resources from land and sea, like crops, \nforests, fish, animals and micro-organisms to produce food, materials and energy. (EU \nCommission definition). Stronger development of the bioeconomy will help the EU accelerate \nprogress towards a circular and low-carbon economy. It will help modernize and strengthen the \nEU industrial base, creating new value chains and greener, more cost-effective industrial \nprocesses, while protecting biodiversity and the environment.\nBiobased economy, bioeconomy or biotechonomy is an economic activity involving the use of \nbiotechnology and biomass in the production of goods, services, or energy. The terms are widely \nused by regional development agencies, national and international organizations, and \nbiotechnology companies. They are closely linked to the evolution of the biotechnology industry \nand the capacity to study, understand, and manipulate genetic material that has been possible due \nto scientific research and technological development. This includes the application of scientific \nand technological developments to agriculture, health, chemical, and energy industries.\nThe terms bioeconomy (BE) and bio-based economy (BBE) are sometimes used interchangeably. \nHowever, it is worth to distinguish them: the biobased economy takes into consideration the \nproduction of non-food goods, whilst bioeconomy covers both bio-based economy and the \nproduction and use of food and feed.\nAccording to European Union Bioeconomy Strategy updated in 2018 the bioeconomy covers all \nsectors and systems that rely on biological resources (animals, plants, micro-organisms and \nderived biomass, including organic waste), their functions and principles. It covers all primary \nproduction and economic and industrial sectors that base on use, production or processing \nbiological resources from agriculture, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture. The product of \nbioeconomy are typically food, feed and other biobased products, bioenergy and services based \non biological resources. The bioeconomy aims to drive towards sustainability, circularity as well \nas the protection of the environment and will enhance biodiversity. \nIn some definitions, bioeconomy comprises also ecosystem services that are services offered by \nthe environment, including binding carbon dioxide and opportunities for recreation. Another key \naspect of the bioeconomy is not wasting natural resources but using and recycling them \nefficiently. \nAccording to EU Bioeconomy Report 2016, the bioeconomy brings together various sectors of \nthe economy that produce, process and reuse renewable biological resources (agriculture, \nforestry, fisheries, food, bio-based chemicals and materials and bioenergy).\nOne opportunity was making economic use of the emerging new potential of using \nbiotechnologies, as indicated above. Another opportunity inherent in the concept of the \nbioeconomy is the replacement of fossil-based resources by bio-based resources, both for energy \nand for material use. In developing the concept of the bioeconomy in the EU, the label \n\"knowledge-based\" was added so that it became the \"knowledge-based bioeconomy\". The label \n\"knowledge-based\" was in line with the EU innovation policy that prevailed at the time.\nThe concept of the knowledge-based economy reflects the vision of achieving economic growth \nthrough high-technology industries, which requires investments in innovation and highly skilled \nlabor.\nThe development of the concept of the bioeconomy was characterized by two perspectives: (1) \nthe resource substitution perspective and (2) the biotechnology innovation perspective.\n\nUses and applications \nThe use and commercialization of products in modern bioeconomy often fall into four main \nfields: environment, medicine, industry and agriculture. Main products categories are:\n1. Therapeutics \n2. Biologics and vaccines \n3. In vitro diagnostics and personalized medicine \n4. Medical devices \n5. Combination device/therapeutics \n6. Digital health IT applications \n7. Research instruments and tools \n8. Bio-crops\n9. Bio-fuels \n10. Industrial biotechnology \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFig. 8. Bioeconomy products (BIOPRO Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany) https://www.biooekonomie-\nbw.de/en/bw/definition/bioeconomy-products)\n\n \nFig. 9. Types of biotechnology generating bioeconomy applications (https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/biotechnology)\n\n\n\nTypes of applications function of domain of interest:\nEnvironment\nThe aim of environmental biotechnology is to develop sustainable environmental practices that \nreduce pollution and waste. The following are examples of environmental biotech:\n*\tPhytoremediation uses genetically engineered microorganisms to purify soils of heavy \nmetals and other pollutants.\n*\tBioremediation introduces microorganisms into waste sites in order to organically break \ndown nonrecyclable waste.\n*\tPlastic-eating bacteria breaks down waste such as plastic in soils and water.\n*\tGMO foods stay fresher longer and reduce food waste.\n*\tGenetic restoration attempts to restore endangered species.\n*\tCover-crops such as corn are used as biofuels, replacing traditional fuel sources that \nproduce greenhouse gas emissions when extracted and used.\nMost genetic engineering is performed in laboratories. \nMedicine\nMedical biotechnology, also known as biopharma, aims to fight and prevent disease and improve \nhealthcare. Biotechnology and biomedical research are the basis of the modern pharmaceutical \nindustry. Uses include the followings\n*\tstem cell research that helps replace or repair dead or defective cells;\n*\tantibiotics development;\n*\tgene therapies for diseases such as leukemia;\n*\tresearch into dangerous pathogens and the antibodies that fight them;\n*\t3D printing or growing of organs and bones in labs; and\n*\tmRNA vaccines, monoclonal antibody treatments and research for COVID-19.\nIndustry\nIndustrial biotechnology involves using microorganisms to produce industrial goods. Examples \ninclude the followings:\n*\tProduction of industrial enzymes;\n*\tIndustrial biotechnology processes are being employed to create bio plastics;\n*\tFermentation and the use of enzymes and microbes to streamline chemical manufacturing \nand reduce operational costs and chemical emissions;\n*\tBiofuels that use renewable crops such as corn to produce combustible fuel instead of \nnatural, nonrenewable fossil fuel resources, such as petroleum and oil; and\n*\tBiodegradable garments and textiles made from the proteins of living organisms, such as \nthe silk proteins of spiders.\nAgriculture\nBio agricultural products can be divided into three major sectors: seeds, agro bio products \ninstead of agro chemicals, and bio fertilizers.\nAgricultural biotechnology can produce genetically engineered plants and animals to realize a \nmore efficient agriculture, increase nutritional value and reduce food insecurity. Some examples \nof agricultural biotechnology are the followings:\n*\tAnimal cells and plant cells cultivation technologies;\n*\tModern food biotechnology based on genetically modified organisms\n*\tBiologically produced pesticides and herbicides that are less harmful to humans than \nchemical ones;\n*\tDrought-resistant crops;\n*\tMinimal space-resilient crops;\n*\tMeat grown in labs or using 3D printers;\n*\tGluten-free grains friendly to sufferers of celiac;\n*\tSelective breeding that produces healthier, bigger livestock and crops; and\n*\tNutrient supplementation that infuses food with added nutrients to improve diets and \nmedical treatments.\n\n2. CIRCULAR BIOECONOMY\nBiomass is projected to play a key role in meeting global climate targets. To achieve a resource-\nefficient biomass use, European bioeconomy strategies increasingly consider the concept of a \ncircular bioeconomy (CBE).\nThe updated bioeconomy strategy of the European Commission (2018a) announces that the \n\"European Bioeconomy needs to have sustainability and circularity at its heart\". Many key \nstrategies towards a more resource-efficient and circular bioeconomy, e.g. integrated \nbiorefineries and cascading use of biomass depend on a close cooperation of local actors from \nagriculture, industry, research and regional public institutions, e.g. within bioeconomy clusters.\nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2013) implied that the bioeconomy is an integral part of the \nCE by including the biological cycle into their CE illustration. Similarly, Temmes and Peck \n(2019) see the CBE as a CE where \"non-renewable inputs to industrial systems are replaced by \nrenewable biological resources\". The European Commission (2017) defined the CBE as the \napplication of the CE concept to biological resources, products and materials.\n\n \nFig. 10. The Circular bioeconomy (CBE) in relation with Bioeconomy (BE)and Circular \nEconomy (CE)\n\nThe circular bioeconomy focuses on the sustainable, resource-efficient valorization of biomass in \nintegrated, multi-output production chains (e.g. biorefineries) while also making use of residues \nand wastes and optimizing the value of biomass over time via cascading. Such an optimization \ncan focus on economic, environmental or social aspects and ideally considers all three pillars of \nsustainability. The cascading steps aim at retaining the resource quality by adhering to the bio-\nbased value pyramid and the waste hierarchy where possible and adequate (Paul Stegmann et al., \nResources, Conservation and Recycling, X6, 2020, 100029) \n \nFig. 11. The Circular Bioeconomy and its elements (Paul Stegmann et al., Resources, \nConservation and Recycling, X6, 2020, 100029) \n\n \nFig. 12. Bio-base value pyramid ((aul Stegmann et al., Resources, Conservation and Recycling, \nX6, 2020, 100029) \n\nIn a CBE, more biomass would ideally first be delegated to a material use before - after one \nor potentially multiple cascading steps - it would be delegated to a final energetic use or \ncomposting. In theory, this cascading would follow a movement down the bio-based value \npyramid and the waste hierarchy, moving from high value to lower value biomass applications. \nMoving from the upper part of the bio-based value pyramid and the waste hierarchy to the lower \npart theoretically goes along with decreasing options for further uses and cascading \nopportunities, due to the lowering of the resource quality. Staying on the upper part of both \nhierarchies would therefore theoretically be desirable in a CBE. However, in practice, \napplications on the lower part might still be preferable from an environmental and economic \nperspective.\nPractitioners in bioeconomy clusters can support the development towards a CBE by (1) \nfacilitating cooperation between stakeholders along and across supply chains; (2) fostering bio-\nbased product design that facilitates durability, reuse, repair, recycling or biodegradability; (3) \nfostering the use of residues and wastes as resource; (4) intensifying the cooperation with the \nwaste management sector to ensure that the bio-based products can be integrated in collection, \nseparation, recycling and composting schemes.\nIn the intersection area that defines the CBE concept, three complementary views can be found \nas key interfaces between CBE and CE. First, the utilization of biomass as a resource. Since this \nincludes \"by-products\", \"residues\" and \"waste\", using it keeps material in the economy for \nlonger, closes material loops, and increases resources productivity. Second, the cascading use of \nbiomass, i.e. the sequential recycling of a material into another type of product after its use. \nHere, the main target of both cascading use and CE is an increased resource efficiency and lower \ndemand for raw materials, with both being frequently linked to value addition and job creation. \n(A.S. Brandao et al., Journal of Cleaner Production 295 ,2021, 126407). The pulp and paper or \ntextile industries are good examples of how cascading has been used for decades, long before the \nterm itself became mainstream. Third, the strive to create a more sustainable and resource \nefficient society. In this regard, both CE and CBE minimize the use of fossil fuels. The CE \nconcept strengthens the resource efficiency of processes and the use of recycled materials to \nreduce the demand for fossil carbon, while CBE substitutes fossil carbon by renewable carbon \nfrom biomass (Carus and Dammer, 2018). Thus, CBE emerges as the result of the pursuit of a \nmore sustainable and resource efficient world, providing various societal, economic and \nenvironmental benefits.\nRecycling and other circular waste management practices are a key part of the CBE paradigm, as \nexemplified by the sustainable, resource-efficient valorization of biomass in integrated \nproduction chains (e.g. biorefineries) while making use of residues and wastes. For instance, the \nproduct sectors related to plastics and building materials have significant recycling and cascading \npotential. However, established waste management practices do not necessarily result in the most \neconomical or environmentally friendly solution. In fact, key challenges for implementing \ncircular strategies include costs (besides e.g. policies and regulations, and the current small size \nof bio-based markets). In this context, Stegmann et al. (2020) suggest the optimization of the \nvalue of biomass over time as a key characteristic of the CBE. Such an optimization can focus on \neconomic (e.g. for profit), environmental (e.g. for GHG emissions) and/or social aspects (e.g. for \njob).\nThe circular bioeconomy has great potential to catalyze an inclusive European economic, \npolitical and societal project that is urgently needed.\nThe shift to a circular biobased economic paradigm should be a long-term strategy for \ndecoupling economic growth from environmental degradation.\nRecommendations for European circular bioeconomy development (Hetemaki L. et al., \nLeading the way to a European circular bioeconomy strategy. From Science to Policy 5. \nEuropean Forest Institute, 2017):\nCircular bioeconomy strategies should not take sustainability as a given, but address it explicitly.\na.\tThere can be synergies between economic growth and improvement in the state of natural \ncapital. The pace of growth is not the problem, but rather the quality of growth. It \nrequires the advancement of truly sustainable economic growth, and not the type of \nunsustainable growth often seen in the past. One essential requirement is that renewable \nresources are not used to the extent that they can no longer reproduce themselves, i.e. \nthey become non-renewable. \nb.\tNatural capital is a necessary production input along with the traditional ones,\nc.\tResearch, development and innovation (R&D&I) needs to increase to strengthen the \nfoundations of a circular bioeconomy.\nA circular bioeconomy can help to support biodiversity and climate mitigation; biodiversity and \nclimate mitigation are necessary for a successful circular bioeconomy.\n\n\n \nFig. 13. Societal, economic, and environmental benefits of CBE approach (source: adapted from \nBIOWAYS's public consultation on the bioeconomy, available at http://www.bioways.eu/).\n\n3. REFINING SOLID WASTE TO PRODUCTS AND ENERGY\nThe core specific technological operations characteristic to circular bioeconomy are:  waste \nuse, cascading principle of biomass use, biorefining.\nBiorefining concept. \nBiorefining, the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of marketable biobased products and \nbioenergy/biofuels, is an innovative and efficient approach to use available biomass resources for the \nsynergistic coproduction of power, heat and biofuels alongside food and feed ingredients, \npharmaceuticals, chemicals, materials, minerals and short-cyclic CO2. A biorefinery is an overall concept \nof a processing plant where biomass feedstocks are converted and extracted into a spectrum of valuable \nproducts. (https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/glossary-item/biorefinery_en)\nBiorefining is one of the keys enabling strategies of the Circular Economy, closing loops of raw biomass \nmaterials (re-use of forestry, agro, process and postconsumer residues), minerals, water and carbon. \nTherefore, biorefining is the optimal strategy for large-scale sustainable use of biomass in the Bio \nEconomy. It will result in cost-competitive co-production of food/feed ingredients, biobased products and \nbioenergy combined with optimal socio-economic and environmental impacts (efficient use of resources, \nreduced GHG emissions, etc.).\n\n \nFig.14. Cascading principle of biomass use is illustrated for wood biomass, conforming to EU \nCommission vision (https://saf.org.ua/en/news/1399/)\n\n \nFig. 15. Biorefinery concept illustration (https://www.ctc-n.org/technologies/biorefinery)\n\nExamples of integrated biorefineries of biomass waste:\n\n \nFig. 16. Biorefinery potential for various products and energy sources (R. A. Quevedo-Amador et \nal., Application of waste biomass for the production of biofuels and catalysts: a review, Clean \nTechnologies and Environmental Policy, 2024)\n\n \nFig. 17. Borregaard biorefinery for lignocellulosic biomass waste in operation in Norway, Borregaard \noperating one of the world's most advanced and sustainable biorefineries. (BALI TM process) \n(https://www.borregaard.com/)\nThe bioprocessing of lignocellulosic biomass to produce bio-based products under biorefinery setup is \ngaining global attention. The economic viability of this biorefinery would be inclined by the efficient \nbioconversion of all three major constituents of lignocellulosic biomass i.e. cellulose, hemicellulose, and \nlignin for value-added biochemicals and biofuels production. Although the lignocellulosic biorefinery \nsetup has a clear value proposition, the commercial success at the industrial scale is still inadequate. This \ncan be attributed mainly to irregular biomass supply chain, market uncertainties, and scale-up challenges. \nGlobal research efforts are underway by public and private sectors to get deeper market penetration. A \ncomprehensive account of important factors, limitations, and propositions are worth consideration for the \ncommercial success of lignocellulosic biorefineries.\nURBIOFIN is an innovation project funded by the Bio Based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) \nunder the EU Horizon 2020 program and coordinated by \"PERSEO BIOTECHNOLOGY S.L. \n(PERSEO)\". The aim of the URBIOFIN project is to demonstrate techno-economic and environmental \nviability of an integrated and innovative biorefinery for the transformation of the organic fraction of \nmunicipal solid waste (MSW) into new marketable bioproducts, chemical building blocks, biopolymers \nand additives.\nProject title: Demonstration of an integrated innovative biorefinery for the transformation of \nMunicipal Solid Waste (MSW) into new Bio Based products (URBIOFIN)\nAcronym: URBIOFIN\nType: Innovation Action - \"Demonstration Action\"\nPartners involved: The URBIOFIN Consortium is composed of 15 recognized key actors on the \ntopics of Waste management, Bioprocessing technologies (industrial processes relying on \nbiological agents to drive the process), Bioproducts (products that are manufactured using \nbiological material as feedstock) and Biomaterials, Biofuels, Municipal Solid Waste, industrial \nprocesses and integration.\n*\tIndustry: URBASER S.A., BIOMASA PENINSULAR S.A., Novozymes A/S, \nNATUREPLAST SAS, NATRUE AISBL, IRIS Technology Solutions S.L., Leygatech \nSAS, ETAM SA\n*\tResearch Organisations: ainia, Wageningen University & Bioresearch, Centro de \nInvestigaciones Energéticas Medioambientales y Tecnológicas, IRIAF (CLAMBER \nBiorefinery), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas\n*\tUniversities: University of Valladolid\nToday, in Europe, each inhabitant generates in average 0.5 tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) \nper year. Around 40-50% of it corresponds to organic waste. This organic fraction mainly \ncontains carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, which are all useful raw materials that can be \nconverted to valuable products. Its valorization will help to solve environmental pollution, but \nalso contribute to the transition from a linear to a renewable circular economy. Digestion and \ncomposting have contributed to the reduction of the biodegradable fraction of MSW sent to \nlandfill. However, the low economical value of compost and biogas is limiting the sustainable \nimplementation of separate sourcing systems. New bio-based products obtained from waste \ntreatment can contribute to the environmental and socio-economical sustainability. Therefore, the \naim of URBIOFIN project is to demonstrate the techno-economic and environmental feasibility \nof the conversion at semi-industrial scale (10 T/day) of the organic fraction of MSW into: \nChemical building blocks (bioethanol, volatile fatty acids, biogas), biopolymers \n(polyhydroyalkanoate and biocomposites) or additives (bioethylene, microalgae hydrolisated for \nbiofertilisers). By using the biorefinery concept applied to MSW, URBIOFIN will exploit the \norganic fractions of MSW as feedstock to produce different valuable marketable products for \ndifferent markets like agriculture and cosmetics.\n\n\n\n \nFig. 18. Operating flow in case of URBIOFIN demonstration plant (https://www.urbiofin.eu)\n\n\n\nCircular bioeconomy, much similar to the circular economy, aims at \"closing the loop\" to prevent \nexpansive and unfettered extraction of biological resources and define goals such as \nsustainability and environmental protection. The \"zero-waste\" policy of circular bioeconomy has \nfueled the development of waste biorefineries, microalgal biorefineries, and lignocellulosic \nbiorefineries. Environmental protection by sustaining the regional ecological balance and \nwatchful emission controls is deemed vital. Global inclusiveness in the development of an \norganization to oversee knowledge sharing, development of global testing standards, assessment \nof the demand and supply of bio-based products, and supporting research and development in \nbiotechnology for commercialization will help realize the successful transition to circular \nbioeconomy."

            "context": "MODULE IV. GREEN / SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE\n\nEU target: \n*\tensure food security in the face of geopolitical uncertainties, climate change and \nbiodiversity loss\n*\treduce the environmental and climate footprint of the EU food system\n*\tstrengthen the EU food system's resilience\n*\tlead a global transition towards competitive sustainability from farm to fork\nIntensive conventional agriculture contributes to climate change, water pollution, loss of \nbiodiversity, or natural-resource depletion, as well as being directly affected by it. Even though \nsuch concerns are broadly acknowledged, we continue to uphold excessive and unsustainable \nproduction or consumption habits that are responsible for exceeding our planet's boundaries or \nreaching irreversible tipping points. Due to our population growth rate, we must simultaneously \nfocus on feeding humanity while not depleting natural resources.\nThis is why the future is the application of Green / Sustainable agriculture, which can be \ndefined as desired type of agricultural activity to supply society's food and textile needs in \nthe present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. \nSo, it is to develop a healthy food system for people and planet and it is a type of agriculture that \nis the opposite of intensive agriculture.\nSustainable agriculture aims to reduce CO2 emissions, avoid soil degradation from pesticides and \nfertilizers, conserve water, and increase biodiversity. However, achieving this goal requires \nconsidering various social and economic factors. One crucial aspect is the integration of \ninnovative technologies that could either help to transition to sustainable agriculture or worsen \nthe environmental impact of industrial agriculture. In essence, sustainable agriculture aims to \nproduce food without harming the environment while ensuring fair conditions for farmers and \nworkers.\nSustainable agriculture aims to tackle the two main challenges facing humanity resulting from \nconventional farming practices: environmental degradation and climate change. The link \nbetween healthy people, healthy societies and a healthy planet puts sustainable food systems at \nthe heart of the European Green Deal, the EU's sustainable and inclusive growth strategy. It is \ndesigned to boost the economy, improve people's health and quality of life, and care for nature.\nI.\tCAP-COMMON AGRICULTURE POLICY\nEU's CAP is central to the EU Green Deal & its Farm to Fork and Biodiversity strategies.\nThe European agriculture and food system, supported by the Common Agricultural Policy, is \nalready a global standard in terms of safety, security of supply, nutrition and quality. Now, it \nmust also become the global standard for sustainability. A shift to a sustainable food system, \nwhile ensuring food affordability and availability, brings environmental, health and social \nbenefits, as well as offering fairer economic gains.\nThat is why in July 2023 the Commission adopted a package of measures for a sustainable use of \nkey natural resources, which will also strengthen the resilience of European food systems and \nfarming. The package includes a new soil law, which will help us have healthy soils in the EU by \n2050, a regulation on plants produced by genome techniques, and measures to reduce food and \ntextile waste. Its adoption completes the previous proposals under the 'natural resources' pillar of \nthe European Green Deal.\nToday the CAP supports a modern, market-oriented farming sector providing safe, affordable, \nhigh-quality food, produced sustainably and respecting consumer standards (environmental, \nanimal welfare, food safety, etc.), as well as supporting investment in the broader rural economy. \nThe CAP is a common policy for all EU countries, managed and funded at European level from \nthe EU's budget:\n*\tincome support through direct payments that help protect income stability for farmers \nwho comply with environmental and social requirements; \n*\tmarket 'measures' to help the agri-food sector deal with difficult market situations; \n*\trural development 'interventions' addressing specific needs and challenges facing rural \nEurope. \n \nFig. 1. EEA, 2019, \"Nature's nutrient cycle\" (https://www.eea.europa.eu/signals/signals-2019-\ncontent-list/infographics/agriculture/view)\nThe common agricultural policy (CAP) is built around three main goals to achieve a sustainable \nsystem of agriculture in the EU: economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, and. \nthe social sustainability of farms.\nMain objectives:\n1. Ensuring viable farm income\nSupport viable farm income and the resilience of the agricultural sector across the EU in order to \nenhance long-term food security and agricultural diversity as well as to ensure the economic \nsustainability of agricultural production.\n \nFig 2. CAP specific objectives\n2. Increasing competitiveness: the role of productivity\nEnhance market orientation and increase farm competitiveness both in the short and long term, \nincluding greater focus on research, technology and digitalization.\n3. Farmer position in value chains\nProviding measures that aim to strengthen farmers' position in a continuously evolving value \nchain, increase market transparency, and ensure effective mechanisms against unfair trading \npractices.\n4. Agriculture and climate mitigation\nContribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, including by reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions and enhancing carbon sequestration as well as promoting sustainable energy.\n5. Efficient soil management\nFoster sustainable development and efficient management of natural resources such as water, soil \nand air, including by reducing chemical dependency.\n6. Biodiversity and farmed landscapes\nContribute to halting and reversing biodiversity loss, enhance ecosystem services and preserve \nhabitats and landscapes.\n7. Structural change and generational renewal\nAttract and sustain young farmers and new farmers and facilitate sustainable business \ndevelopment in rural areas.\n8. Jobs and growth in rural areas\nPromote employment, growth, gender equality, including the participation of women in farming, \nsocial inclusion and local development in rural areas, as well as the circular bio-economy and \nsustainable forestry.\n9. Health, Food & Antimicrobial Resistance\nImprove the response of EU agriculture to societal demands relating to food and health, \nincluding high-quality, safe and nutritious food produced in a sustainable way, to reduce food \nwaste, as well as to improve animal welfare and combat antimicrobial resistance.\n10. Driving simplification\nModernize agriculture and rural areas by fostering and sharing knowledge, innovation and \ndigitalization and by encouraging their uptake by farmers through improved access to research, \ninnovation, knowledge exchange and training.\nImprovements to existing requirements will also further increase sustainability, for example:\na) To improve long-term soil health, in principle farmers will be required to carry out beneficial \ncrop rotations. Crop \"diversification\" (the current obligation) will be permitted as an alternative \nalthough it does not have the same benefit for soil health as crop rotation. With exemptions taken \ninto account, the obligation of crop rotation or diversification will apply to an estimated 86% of \nthe EU's arable land.\nb) Farmers will also increase their contribution to biodiversity by in principle devoting at least \n4% of their arable land to non-productive features and areas, including fallow land. The \nobligatory minimum for such non-productive features will be 3% where farmers \"top up\" that \ntotal to 7% through an eco-scheme, or where farmers devote significant additional land to catch \ncrops or nitrogen-fixing crops (cultivated without plant protection products or fertilizers in each \ncase).\nCompatibility with the Green Deal\nAs a first step, the nine common objectives cover economic, social and environmental \ndimensions. In line with the Green Deal's ambitions, they aim to increase the contribution of EU \nagriculture to climate change action, improve the management of natural resources, ensure a fair \neconomic return for farmers, and reinforce the protection of biodiversity, among others.\nThe new way of working proposed for the future CAP is one of the key elements that makes the \nproposals compatible with the Green Deal. Based on a thorough assessment of the local \nconditions and needs, Member States will produce a national CAP strategic plan that will explain \nhow they will use CAP tools to achieve the nine objectives, in consultation with stakeholders and \ncompetent national authorities. In addition, to ensure that these plans are coherent and consistent \nwith the required environmental ambition, the Commission will approve each CAP strategic \nplans ahead of their implementation. Finally, quantified targets will allow the Commission to \nmonitor the progress made by Member States when implementing the CAP.\nIn addition, the CAP proposal includes tools that will further promote sustainable farming \npractices throughout the EU, crucial to achieve the Green Deal's ambitions.\nAmong those, the future CAP includes conditionality, which links area and animal-based CAP \npayments to a range of obligations. In addition, it also introduces the new 'eco-schemes' that \naim to reward farmers for going further in the implementation of sustainable agricultural \npractices. These practices could include the implementation of environmentally friendly \nproduction systems such as agroecology, agroforestry and organic farming. The rural \ndevelopment framework also includes environmental and climate management commitments, \nwhich aim to compensate farmers and other beneficiaries for voluntarily committing themselves \nto implement sustainable practices.\nFurthermore, other tools under rural development can support the transition. For example, \nfunds can be used to invest in green infrastructure, in knowledge transfer and innovation or in \ndeveloping access to fast broadband in rural areas. On top of this, the CAP proposals include that \na minimum of 30% of rural development funds should go towards CAP interventions that \naddress specific environmental and climate-related objectives.\nFurthermore, the CAP proposals also include objectives on rebalancing power in the food \nsupply chain as well as contributing to new societal demands related to food and health, \nincluding safe, nutritious and sustainable food, food waste, and animal welfare. In practical \nterms, this means that Member States are required to review their actions in these areas and \npropose how to use different CAP tools to address challenges identified. For instance, the \nCommission will continue to support cooperation between producers through producer \norganizations. These types of organizations allow producers to strengthen their position in the \nsupply chain, increase their resilience and act collectively to enhance sustainability of the supply \nchain. These objectives are also reflected in the Green Deal's ambitions. They will be essential to \nenable the transition while leaving no one behind.\nAdapting and applying research on the ground: The European Innovation Partnership for \nAgricultural Productivity and Sustainability (EIP-AGRI) will continue to help translate research \nresults into innovations \"on the ground\" - with support from CAP tools financing related \ninvestments, co-operation and knowledge exchange and innovation support services.\nThe common agricultural policy (CAP) 2023-27 entered into force on 1 January 2023. This \nmarked the beginning of the implementation of the 28 approved CAP Strategic Plans in 27 EU \ncountries (EU members have one Strategic Plan each, except Belgium, which has one for \nFlanders and one for Wallonia).\nA total of 386.6 billion is available for the CAP from the EU budget (2021-2027). This is \ndivided between two funds (often referred to as the 'two pillars' of the CAP). These are: \n*\tthe European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF), known as Pillar 1, which provides \n291.1 billion of direct financial support to farmers;  \n*\tthe European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), known as Pillar 2, \nwhich provides 95.5 billion (including 8.1 billion from the Next Generation EU \nrecovery instrument) for socio-economic and environmental interventions. \nIn November 2023, the European Commission published an assessment of CAP Strategic Plans \n(CSP) delivery on CAP objectives. The report relies on the information contained in the CAP \nnational plans as well as on qualitative appraisals of the potential effects of the choices made by \nEU countries. This preliminary assessment summarizes the combined contributions of the \ninterventions planned by EU countries to address the CAP specific objectives and the six EU-\nwide Green Deal targets on:\n*\tFairer income for farmers and keeping rural areas vibrant;\n*\tEnvironment and climate action;\n*\tSocial sustainability and societal expectations such as animal welfare.\n \n \nFig. 3. EU budget distribution for CAP for the period 2023-2027\nDirections of action:\na. A stronger position for farmers in the marketplace:\n* Improved rules on competition: Limited exemptions from competition law will be expanded \nin a well-targeted manner - allowing farmers to work together to strengthen their position in the \nfood supply chain. This includes derogations for agreements setting higher sustainability \nstandards as well as possibilities for supply regulation for foodstuffs with protected geographical \nnames.\nb. Social conditionality: linking support to respect of rights of farm workers. The new CAP \nsteps up the support for generational renewal and participation of women in the farming sector\nc. Improving the knowledge base: By allowing transfers of CAP funds to the EU Erasmus \nprogram, the CAP offers Member States an opportunity to enhance the transnational learning-\nrelated mobility of young farmers and of women from rural areas.\nd. Comprehensive and strategic approach: Each Member State will have to set out in its CAP \nPlan (CSP) its strategy for stimulating innovation and modernization. This strategy should refer, \namong other things, to:\n-the overall organization of the Member State's Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation System \n(AKIS);\n-the way in which CAP networks, advisory services and research will cooperate in the context of \nAKIS;\n-a strategic approach towards the digitalization of farming and rural areas. EUR 9 billion for \nresearch and innovation in the area of Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and \nEnvironment are part of the Horizon Europe program 2021-2027. \ne. At the same time, the higher level of resources allocated to the complementary redistributive \nincome support for sustainability (CRISS) reinforces income support that goes directly to \nsmaller and medium-sized farms.\nf. There is a pattern across the EU to supplement income support for farming in areas with \nnatural and other constraints (ANC). By compensating higher costs of producing food and \nfeed in areas affected by poor climate, soil or other conditions such as mountains or land in dry \nor cold territories, this support helps maintain agricultural activity in such areas and positively \ninfluences socio-economic factors.\ng. Overall, 35% of the EU's farmland should benefit from land-based voluntary actions for \nboth carbon sequestration and reduction of N2O emissions.\nh. CSPs' support for extensive livestock systems helps to maintain not only carbon stocks but \nalso traditional landscapes, while improving feed autonomy and economic activities on marginal \nland. Many CSPs recognize explicitly the need to reduce livestock-related emissions (notably \nmethane from ruminants). In particular, CSPs include support for investments in: improving \nmanure storage and management; equipment for low-emission slurry spreading; and anaerobic \ndigesters. This will be supplemented by support for genetic improvements.\ni. The potential to increase sustainable energy production through the CSPs comes mainly \nfrom support for the use of agro-photovoltaics and investment in biomethane production.\nj. Approaches to adapt to the decrease of available water and ensure long-term resilience \n(through nature-based solutions, water retention in the landscape, less water-intensive crops, \nwater reuse) will have to be reinforced and better integrated with long-term strategic planning. \nBy 2027, an estimated 10% of the EU's agricultural area should receive CSP support for \norganic farming.\nk. The CSPs contribute to increasing the presence of high diversity landscape features \ntowards the Biodiversity Strategy target of 10% of agricultural land by 2030. The \nstrengthened obligation to dedicate at least 4% of arable land to nonproductive elements is a \nsignificant change for those Member States and farmers who relied on productive areas \n(nitrogen-fixing crops and catch crops) to comply with 'greening'.\nl. All CSPs demonstrate some contribution towards the targets stemming from the EU \nHabitats and Birds Directives. Areas of EU grassland protected against conversion and \nploughing have expanded by 9%, and voluntary measures for improved management aim to \ncover 25% of Natura 2000 areas.\n\nAbout the sustainable use of pesticides\nOver the past 10 years, the EU agricultural sector made significant steps towards a more \nsustainable future, without impacting its capacity to supply quality food:\n*\tin 2019, pesticides sales declined by almost 30 000 tons (7% compared to 2011),\n*\tgreenhouse gas emissions have been around 435 million tons of CO2-equivalent, a 25% \ndecrease compared to 1990,\n*\tthe area under organic production reached 13.8 million ha in 2019, following an annual \nincrease of 5.5 % over the period 2012-2019,\n*\tover the last ten years, the EU organic food and drink market doubled its size, worth \naround 41 billion in 2019,\n*\tthe gross value-added of the EU agricultural production reached 224 billion euro in 2019, \na 19% increase compared to 2010,\n*\tthe EU agri-food products trade balance recorded an annual growth of almost 10% in \naverage between 2010 and 2020, reaching 62 billion euro of net trade in 2020.\nIn the meantime, climate change and biodiversity loss are already impacting EU agriculture:\n*\t50% of land in the EU cultivated with crops dependent on pollinators faces a pollination \ndeficit,\n*\tDroughts are costing an average of 9 billion euro a year in economic damage to \nagriculture, energy and public water supply,\n*\tAntimicrobial resistance linked to excessive and inappropriate use in animal and human \nhealthcare leads to an estimated 33,000 human deaths a year,\n*\tGlobal mean crop yields of rice, maize and wheat are projected to decrease -3% to -10% \nper degree of warming.\nSo, it was the moment to reinforce the regulations on pesticides use. The European Commission \nhas adopted a proposal for a new Regulation on the Sustainable Use of Plant Protection Products, \nincluding EU wide targets to reduce by 50% the use and risk of chemical pesticides by 2030, in \nline with the EU's Farm to Fork and Biodiversity strategies.\nThe proposal, adopted on 22 June 2022, is part of a package of measures to reduce the \nenvironmental footprint of the EU's food system and help mitigate the economic losses that we \nare already suffering due to climate change and biodiversity loss. The main measures include:\n*\tLegally binding targets at EU level to reduce by 50% the use and the risk of chemical \npesticides as well as the use of the more hazardous pesticides by 2030. Member States \nwill set their own national reduction targets within defined parameters to ensure that the \nEU wide targets are achieved.\n*\tEnvironmentally friendly pest control: New measures will ensure that all farmers and \nother professional pesticide users practice Integrated Pest Management (IPM). This is an \nenvironmentally friendly system of pest control which focuses on pest prevention and \nprioritizes alternative pest control methods, with chemical pesticides only used as a last \nresort.\n*\tA ban on all pesticides in sensitive areas: The use of all pesticides is prohibited in \nplaces such as urban green areas, including public parks or gardens, playgrounds, \nrecreation or sports grounds, public paths as well as protected areas in accordance with \nNatura 2000 and any ecologically sensitive area to be preserved for threatened \npollinators.\n\nII.\tFARM TO FORK STRATEGY\nThe Farm to Fork Strategy is at the heart of the Green Deal. This strategy aims to reward those \nfarmers, fishers and other operators in the food chain who have already undergone the transition \nto sustainable practices, enable the transition for the others, and create additional opportunities \nfor their businesses. As such, even though the EU's transition to sustainable food systems has \nstarted in many areas, food systems remain one of the key drivers of climate change and \nenvironmental degradation. There is an urgent need to reduce dependency on pesticides and \nantimicrobials, reduce excess fertilization, increase organic farming, improve animal \nwelfare, and reverse biodiversity loss.\nOverall, European diets are not in line with national dietary recommendations, and the 'food \nenvironment' does not ensure that the healthy option is always the easiest one. If European diets \nwere in line with dietary recommendations, the environmental footprint of food systems would \nbe significantly reduced.\nAt the same time, efforts to tighten sustainability requirements in the EU food system should be \naccompanied by policies that help raise standards globally, in order to avoid the externalization \nand export of unsustainable practices.\nThe EU's goals are to reduce the environmental and climate footprint of the EU food system \nand strengthen its resilience, ensure food security in the face of climate change and biodiversity \nloss and lead a global transition towards competitive sustainability from farm to fork and \ntapping into new opportunities. This means:\n \n1. ensuring that the food chain, covering food production, transport, distribution, marketing and \nconsumption, has a neutral or positive environmental impact, preserving and restoring the \nland, freshwater and sea-based resources on which the food system depends; helping to mitigate \nclimate change and adapting to its impacts; protecting land, soil, water, air, plant and animal \nhealth and welfare; and reversing the loss of biodiversity;\n2. ensuring food security, nutrition and public health - making sure that everyone has access to \nsufficient, nutritious, sustainable food that upholds high standards of safety and quality, plant \nhealth, and animal health and welfare, while meeting dietary needs and food preferences;\n3. preserving the affordability of food, while generating fairer economic returns in the supply \nchain, so that ultimately the most sustainable food also becomes the most affordable, fostering \nthe competitiveness of the EU supply sector, promoting fair trade, creating new business \nopportunities, while ensuring integrity of the single market and occupational health and safety.\nTechnical and financial assistance from existing EU instruments, such as cohesion funds and the \nEuropean Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), will support the transition.\nCombined with certification and labelling on the sustainability performance of food products and \nwith targeted incentives, the framework will allow operators to benefit from sustainable practices \nand progressively raise sustainability standards so as to become the norm for all food products \nplaced on the EU market.\nMAIN ACTIONS:\n1.\tEnsuring sustainable food production\na. As announced in the Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP), the Commission will develop a \nregulatory framework for certifying CO2 removals from the atmosphere based on robust and \ntransparent carbon accounting to monitor and verify the authenticity of carbon removals.\nb. The circular bio-based economy is still a largely untapped potential for farmers and their \ncooperatives. For example, advanced bio-refineries that produce bio-fertilizers, protein feed, \nbioenergy, and bio-chemicals offer opportunities for the transition to a climate-neutral European \neconomy and the creation of new jobs in primary production.\nc. Farmers should grasp opportunities to reduce methane emissions from livestock by developing \nthe production of renewable energy and investing in anaerobic digesters for biogas production \nfrom agriculture waste and residues, such as manure. Farms also have the potential to produce \nbiogas from other sources of waste and residues, such as from the food and beverage industry, \nsewage, wastewater and municipal waste.\nd. Farm houses and barns are often perfect for placing solar panels and such investments should \nbe prioritized in the future CAP Strategic Plans.\ne. The Commission will take additional action to reduce the overall use and risk of chemical \npesticides by 50% and the use of more hazardous pesticides by 50% by 2030. To pave the way to \nalternatives and maintain farmers' incomes, the Commission will take a number of steps. It will \nrevise the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive, enhance provisions on integrated pest \nmanagement (IPM) and promote greater use of safe alternative ways of protecting harvests from \npests and diseases. IPM will encourage the use of alternative control techniques, such as crop \nrotation and mechanical weeding, and will be one of the main tools in reducing the use of, and \ndependency on, chemical pesticides in general, and the use of more hazardous pesticides in \nparticular. The Commission will also facilitate the placing on the market of pesticides containing \nbiological active substances.\nf. The Commission will develop with Member States an integrated nutrient management \naction plan to address nutrient pollution at source and increase the sustainability of the livestock \nsector. The Commission will also work with Member States to extend the application of precise \nfertilization techniques and sustainable agricultural practices of recycling of organic waste into \nrenewable fertilizers (CAP Strategic Plans such as the Farm Sustainability Tool for nutrient \nmanagement).\ng. To help reduce the environmental and climate impact of animal production, avoid carbon \nleakage through imports and to support the ongoing transition towards more sustainable livestock \nfarming, the Commission will facilitate the placing on the market of sustainable and innovative \nfeed additives.\nh. The Commission will therefore take action to reduce overall EU sales of antimicrobials for \nfarmed animals and in aquaculture by 50% by2030. \ni. the Commission is carrying out a study which will look at the potential of new genomic \ntechniques to improve sustainability along the food supply chain. Sustainable food systems also \nrely on seed security and diversity. Farmers need to have access to a range of quality seeds for \nplant varieties adapted to the pressures of climate change. The Commission will take measures to \nfacilitate the registration of seed varieties, including for organic farming, and to ensure easier \nmarket access for traditional and locally-adapted varieties.\nj. the Commission will put forward an Action Plan on organic farming. This will help Member \nStates stimulate both supply and demand for organic products. It will ensure consumer trust and \nboost demand through promotion campaigns and green public procurement. This approach will \nhelp to reach the objective of at least 25% of the EU's agricultural land under organic farming by \n2030 and a significant increase in organic aquaculture.\nk. The new 'eco-schemes' will offer a major stream of funding to boost sustainable practices, \nsuch as precision agriculture, agro-ecology (including organic farming), carbon farming and \nagroforestry.\nl. In parallel to changes in agriculture, the shift to sustainable fish and seafood production \nmust also be accelerated. \nm. Farmed fish and seafood generate a lower carbon footprint than animal production on land. \nIn addition, it will be a significant support by the next European Maritime and Fisheries Fund for \nsustainable seafood farming.\n\n2.\tEnsuring food security\na. The Commission will step up its coordination of a common European response to crises \naffecting food systems in order to ensure food security and safety, reinforce public health and \nmitigate their socio-economic impact in the EU. \nb. Drawing on the lessons learned, the Commission will assess the resilience of the food system \nand develop a contingency plan for ensuring food supply and food security to be put in place \nin times of crisis.\nc. For stimulating sustainable food processing, wholesale, retail, hospitality and food services \npractices the Commission will develop an EU Code of conduct for responsible business and \nmarketing practice accompanied with a monitoring framework.\nd. The deployment of a circular and sustainable EU Bioeconomy will provide business \nopportunities, for instance linked to making use of food waste.\ne. Food packaging plays a key role in the sustainability of food systems. The Commission will \nrevise the food contact materials legislation to improve food safety and public health (in \nparticular in reducing the use of hazardous chemicals), support the use of innovative and \nsustainable packaging solutions using environmentally-friendly, re-usable and recyclable \nmaterials, and contribute to food waste reduction. \nf. Promoting sustainable food consumption and facilitating the shift to healthy, sustainable diets \nit is of great importance. So, to improve the availability and price of sustainable food and to \npromote healthy and sustainable diets in institutional catering, the Commission will determine \nthe best way of setting minimum mandatory criteria for sustainable food procurement.\ng. Reducing food loss and waste\nh. Combating food fraud along the food supply chain\ni. Research and innovation (R&I) are key drivers in accelerating the transition to sustainable, \nhealthy and inclusive food systems from primary production to consumption.\nj. Through its external policies, including international cooperation and trade policy, the EU will \npursue the development of Green Alliances on sustainable food systems with all its partners in \nbilateral, regional and multilateral fora. The EU will promote the global transition to sustainable \nfood systems in international standard setting bodies, relevant multilateral fora and \ninternational events. \nThe Commission will ensure that the strategy is implemented in close coherence with the other \nelements of the Green Deal, particularly the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, the new CEAP and \nthe Zero Pollution ambition.\n\nIII.\tSUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE PROCEDURES\nSustainable agriculture consists of using farming techniques that respect the environment, \nbiodiversity and the earth's natural waste absorption capacity.\nThere is no single model that defines itself as sustainable by nature, but there are several that are \nbased on different or even integrated techniques and knowledge. \n \nFig. 4. Benefits of green / sustainable agricultures procedures (Sherya D. et al., Sustainable \nagriculture: a path towards better future, Food and Scientific Reports, vol. 1, no 9, 2020, 22-27)\n\n1.\tPermaculture\nThe term refers not only to a set of agricultural practices oriented towards the natural \nmaintenance of soil fertility, but also to a design system that intertwines issues from \narchitecture, economics, ecology, anthropology and legal systems. The aim is to optimally and \nethically design and manage landscapes to meet people's needs in harmony with natural \nsystems.\nHere the emphasis is given on the use of perennial crops like fruit trees, nut trees, and shrubs that \nall function together in a designed system that mimics how plants in a natural ecosystem would \nfunction. Permaculture design techniques include herb spirals, keyhole and mandala gardens, \nhugelkultur garden beds (hugelkultur is the process of making raised garden beds filled with \nrotten wood. The result is a low-maintenance garden that doesn't require irrigation or \nfertilization), sheet mulching, and growing grain without tillage, each plant serving multiple \npurposes, and creating swales on contour to hold water high on the landscape.\n2.\tBiodynamic farming\nIt is an approach of farming system where the farm is treated as a living system and significant \nemphasis is given on overall development of the farm. The interrelationships between \ncomponents of the farm i.e. soil, plants, animals and microbes are also considered. Biodynamic \nsystem is a combination of \"biological\" practices which involves age-old organic farming \ntechniques that improve soil health and \"dynamic\" practices which involve the influence of \ncosmic forces to develop the farm, its inhabitants and products. It is reported some biodynamic \npreparations with the main ingredients like cow manure, silica and extracts of different plants \nparts like yarrow flowers, chamomile flowers, oak bark, stinging nettle shoots etc. which can \neither by applied through field spray or by composting.\n3.\tUrban agriculture\nIt covers a wide range of activities, from the cultivation of different types of crops like grains, \nvegetables, mushrooms and fruits, and rearing animals such as poultry and fish to the cultivation \nof non-food products like aromatic and medicinal herbs or ornamental plants. It illuminates a \ndifferent paradigm from the transformation of cities from only consumers of food to generators \nof agricultural products to contribute to sustainability, improved health, and poverty alleviation. \nIt not only uses vacant urban areas for agriculture production but also helps to transform \nwastewater and organic solid waste into resources for growing agriculture products (the former \ncan be used for irrigation, the latter as fertilizer). Another idea is segregating dry and wet wastes \nas well as recycling the kitchen wastes to prepare home-made compost, which will not only help \nto cut back city waste dumps but also provide each and every household a good potting mix for \ngardening.\n4.\tHydroponics and aqua-ponics\nThese innovative farming techniques involve the growing of plants without soil, nourishing the \nplants through specialized nutrients that are added to water. In the hydroponics system, crops are \ngrown with the roots directly exposed to a mineral solution or with the roots in an inert medium \nlike gravel or perlite. Cucumber, lettuce, tomato, peppers are commonly grown in this system. In \naqua-ponics, rising of aquatic animals (such as fish) are combined with growing of hydroponic \ncrops where water containing the waste material from the aquaculture fish is used to nourish the \nhydroponic plants. Both these systems have wide-scale availability from small home-scale \nsystems to commercial-scale systems.\n5.\tAgro-forestry and food forests\nAgro-forestry is an integrated approach of using the interactive benefits from combining trees \nand shrubs with crops. It combines agricultural and forestry technologies to create more diverse, \nproductive, profitable, healthy and sustainable land-use systems. Besides becoming an additional \nsource of income for farmers, trees create a favorable microclimate (that maintains favorable \ntemperature and soil humidity, while protecting crops from wind or heavy rain), stabilize soils, \nminimize nutrient runoff and improve soil structure. Food forests are designed permaculture \nsystems that consist of a multilayered edible \"forest.\" Such a \"forest\" is composed almost \nentirely of perennial food plants, including a canopy of tall and dwarf fruit and nut trees, a fruit \nshrub layer, layers of perennial herbs, mushrooms and vegetables at the ground level, climbing \nplants, and root vegetables underground.\n \nFig. 5. Different models of agro-forestry (Sherya D. et al., Sustainable agriculture: a path \ntowards better future, Food and Scientific Reports, vol. 1, no 9, 2020, 22-27)\n\n6.\tPoly-cultures and crop rotation\nIn order to tackle pest and weed problems (as some pests prefer specific host), maintain and \nenhance the soil quality, cope up with weather fluctuations, ensure additional income to the \nfarmers and a healthy diet to the community, poly-culture and crop rotation over monoculture is \nvery scientific and innovative approach. Here emphasis is given on the fact that crops which are \ngrowing together should be complementary to each other.\n7.\tGrowing heirlooms and older varieties\nIn order to meet market demand for the viability of produce to travel long distances and to be \nstored for long periods of time, only a few varieties are grown commercially. This reduced \ngenetic variability in food crops leads to their inability to adapt to changes in climate, disease \nand pest incidence. To save the gene pool of indigenous varieties, preserve the biodiversity of \nseeds, establish future climate-resistant varieties, growing of heirloom and older varieties and \nsaving their seeds are very important.\n8.\tNatural animal rising\nTo protect the crop from animal consumption, industrial agriculture keeps livestock grazing \naway from the farm, simultaneously crops away from manure. But there exists a mutually \nbeneficial relationship between grazing animals and grassland. Through managed grazing, in one \nhand, wide variety of nutrients will be provided to the animals, on the other hand excessive foot \nfall will help to compact the soil thus preventing soil erosion while the manure left behind will \nenrich the soil.\n9.\tMulching, groundcovers and manual weed control\nIn order to provide a protective layer to the soil, restrict proliferation of weeds, conserve soil \nmoisture, improve soil health, fertility and shield soil from direct sunlight, mulching and \ngroundcovers is a good option. Mulches can be of both organic and inorganic origin; the former \nconsists of straws, husks, saw dust, grasses and cover crops, manures and composts etc. while the \nlater mostly indicates the polyethylene mulch in which the most popular is the black plastic \nmulch.\n10.\t Natural pest management\nIn this method of controlling pest insects, birds, animals, plants and mechanical practices are \nused instead of using chemicals. The farm can be managed in such a way that it can harbor \nnatural predators of agricultural pests. Using the prey-predator relationship, the population of \nharmful pests is kept under control.\nOrganic pesticides are derived from naturally occurring sources. These include living organisms \nsuch as the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis, which is used to control caterpillar pests, or plant \nderivatives such as pyrethrins (from the dried flower heads of Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium) \nor neem oil (from the seeds of Azadirachta indica). Mineral-based inorganic pesticides such as \nsulfur and copper are also allowed.\nIn addition to pesticides, organic pest control integrates biological, cultural, and genetic controls \nto minimize pest damage. Biological control utilizes the natural enemies of pests, such as \npredatory insects (e.g., ladybugs) or parasitoids (e.g., certain wasps) to attack insect pests. Pest \ncycles can be disrupted with cultural controls, of which crop rotation is the most widely used. \nFinally, traditional plant breeding has produced numerous crop varieties that are resistant to \nspecific pests. The use of such varieties and the planting of genetically diverse crops provide \ngenetic control against pests and many plant diseases.\nThese techniques are defined as components of ORGANIC FARMING, meaning \"agriculture \nin harmony with nature\".\n \n\nIV.\tORGANIC FARMING IN EU\n1.\tOrganic farming procedures\nIt is a production model that only allows the use of natural substances, according to the \nEuropean regulation EEC 2092/91, and aims at avoiding the massive exploitation of natural \nresources. Beside the already mentioned procedures, biological fertilizers are applied and \nnatural-derived biocides. Certified organic farms do not use synthetic chemicals such as \nfertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, pesticides, but only use natural fertilizers and \ntraditional techniques (crop rotation).\nCompared with conventional agriculture, organic farming uses fewer pesticides, reduces soil \nerosion, decreases nitrate leaching into groundwater and surface water, and recycles animal \nwastes back into the farm. These benefits are counterbalanced by higher food costs for \nconsumers and generally lower yields. Indeed, yields of organic crops have been found to be \nabout 25 percent lower overall than conventionally grown crops, although this can vary \nconsiderably depending upon the type of crop. The challenge for future organic agriculture will \nbe to maintain its environmental benefits, increase yields, and reduce prices while meeting the \nchallenges of climate change and an increasing world population.\nFarmers must be certified for their produce and products to be labeled \"organic,\" and there are \nspecific organic standards for crops, animals, and wild-crafted products and for the processing of \nagricultural products. Organic standards in the European Union and the United States, for \nexample, prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, ionizing radiation, sewage sludge, \nand genetically engineered plants or products. In the EU, organic certification and inspection is \ncarried out by approved organic control bodies according to EU standards.\n \nFig. 6. Sustainable agriculture procedures\n\n2.\tEU Organic farming Action Plan\nThe Commission has set out a comprehensive organic action plan for the European Union. \nThrough it, the Commission will aim to achieve the European Green Deal target of 25% of \nagricultural land under organic farming by 2030.\n \nFig. 7. Organic farming area in the total EU agriculture surfaces in 2019\nThe action plan is broken into three interlinked axes that reflect the structure of the food supply \nchain and the Green Deal's sustainability objectives.\nAxis 1: stimulate demand and ensure consumer trust.\nAxis 2: stimulate conversion and reinforce the entire value chain.\nAxis 3: organics leading by example: improve the contribution of organic farming to \nenvironmental sustainability.\nThe three axes will be supported by 23 actions, continuing some of the successful 2014-20 \nactions, as well as putting forward an array of new actions and mobilizing different sources of \nfunding.\nFocus on research and innovation. Organic farming is knowledge-intensive. However, there is \nstill a clear need to further enhance the knowledge so that organic farming can become even \nmore sustainable and also more productive. To support the ambitions of the action plan, the \nCommission intends to dedicate at least 30% of the budget for research and innovation actions in \nthe fields of agriculture, forestry and rural areas to topics specific to or relevant for the organic \nsector. This includes issues such as increased crop yields, genetic biodiversity and alternatives to \ncontentious products.\nAxis 1: stimulate demand and ensure consumer trust\nIncreasing the consumption of organic products and strengthening consumers' trust in them are \nvital to encourage farmers to convert to organics. To support continued growth and maintain a \nprofitable market for organic operators, the Commission will undertake actions to:\n*\tpromote organic farming and the EU logo;\n*\tpromote organic canteens and increase the use of green public procurement;\n*\treinforce organic school schemes;\n*\tprevent food fraud and strengthen consumer trust;\n*\timprove traceability;\n*\tfacilitate the contribution of the private sector.\nAxis 2: stimulating conversion and reinforcing the entire value chain\nTo continue progress in production and processing, the action plan will:\n*\tencourage conversion, investments and exchanges of best practices;\n*\tdevelop sector analysis to increase market transparency;\n*\tsupport the organization of the food chain;\n*\treinforce local and small-value processing and foster short trade circuit;\n*\timprove animal nutrition in accordance with organic rules;\n*\treinforce organic aquaculture.\nAxis 3: organics leading by example: improving the contribution of organic farming to \nsustainability\nThe Commission will further improve the organic sector's contribution to sustainability and \nenvironmental challenges through actions focused on:\n*\treducing climate and environmental footprint;\n*\tenhancing genetic biodiversity and increasing yields;\n*\tdeveloping alternatives to contentious inputs and other plant protection products;\n*\tenhancing animal welfare;\n*\tmaking more efficient use of resources.\n3.\tBiocides through pyrolytic degradation of biomass\nSustainable agriculture employs efficient management of environmental bio-resources which can \nbe used to satisfy anthropogenic needs while maintaining and conserving natural resources at the \nsame time. However, sustainable agriculture also focuses at lowering the pest incidence without \ndisturbing nature's balance. Pyrolysis process is one of the methods chosen in order to strive for \nbio-pesticide formation. Pyrolysis is an eco-sustainable technique in the energy conversion of \nbiomass to produce bio-oil, biochar and syngas. Slow pyrolysis was often selected as it lowers \ndown heating rates and longer retention time enhances vapors formation from complete \nsecondary reactions forming wood vinegar and biochar. Hardwood or softwood vinegar is an \naqueous liquid mixture of organic acids and compounds such as acetic acid, methanol, furfural, \nphenol, acetaldehyde, furan, formic, propionic and butyric acid, and other volatile organics.\n\nV.\tROLE OF BIOFERTILIZERS IN GREEN / SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE\nBiofertilizer refers to the use of microorganisms to meet nutritional needs, whereas in other \ncountries, the term microbial bioinoculant is used. Biofertilizers are bio-based organic fertilizers \nthat either could be from plant or animal sources or from living or dormant microbial cells that \nhave the potential to improve the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of nutrient uptake in plants.\nSo biofertilizers are properly defined as \"the preparations containing live microbes that \nhelp in enhancing soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen, solubilizing phosphorus or \ndecomposing organic wastes or by elevating plant growth through the production of \ngrowth hormones with their biological activities\". Biofertilizers are generally applied in solid \nor dry forms, which are prepared after packing on suitable carriers such as clay minerals, rice \nbran, peat, lignite, wheat bran, humus, and wood charcoal. Carriers increase the shelf life and \nenable the easy handling of microbial inoculants.\nThe benefits of biofertilizers include low cost, enhanced nutrient availability, improved soil \nfertility, protect plants from soil-borne pathogens, sustainable agricultural production, enhanced \nbiotic and abiotic stress tolerance, promote phytohormone production, improve soil health, \ncausing less environmental pollution, and its continued use improves the fertility of soil \nconsiderably.\nBased on the source and raw material, global biofertilizer is marketed under two major \ncategories like organic residue-based biofertilizer and microorganisms based biofertilizer. \nGreen manure, crop residues, treated sewage sludge, and farmyard manure are generally organic-\nbased biofertilizers. While on the contrary, microorganism-based biofertilizers contain beneficial \nmicroorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and algae.\n \nFig. 8. Types of biofertilizers (Chaudhary P. et al., Frontiers in Plant Science, Overview of \nbiofertilizers in crop production and stress management for sustainable agriculture, August 2022)\n\n \nFig. 9. Role of biofertilizers for soil health and crop productivity preserving ((Chaudhary P. et al., \nFrontiers in Plant Science, Overview of biofertilizers in crop production and stress management \nfor sustainable agriculture, August 2022)\n\nOrganic matter is a priority for organic farmers. Organic matter can be applied through the \napplication of manure, compost, and animal by-products, such as feather meal or blood meal.. \nCompost adds organic matter, providing a wide range of nutrients for plants, and adds beneficial \nmicrobes to the soil. Given that these nutrients are mostly in an unmineralized form that cannot \nbe taken up by plants, soil microbes are needed to break down organic matter and transform \nnutrients into a bioavailable \"mineralized\" state. \n\nVI.\tROLE OF GENETIC ENGINEERING PLANTS (GM)-PROS AND CONS\nGenetic modification of crops has substantially focused on improving traits for desirable \noutcomes. It has resulted in the development of crops with enhanced yields, quality, and \ntolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. With the advent of introducing favorable traits into \ncrops, biotechnology has created a path for the involvement of genetically modified (GM) crops \ninto sustainable food production systems. Although these plants heralded a new era of crop \nproduction, their widespread adoption faces diverse challenges due to concerns about the \nenvironment, human health, and moral issues. Mitigating these concerns with scientific \ninvestigations is vital with the purpose of GM crops' deep characterization and of the appropriate \nstrategies to overcome their widespread adoption.\nNew and recent tools for genome editing, with a special focus on the CRISPR/Cas9 platform \nwere elaborated with important impact on the GM crops acceptance for sustainable / green \nagriculture applications. The advancement in molecular tools through plant genome editing \naddresses many of the GM crop issues and facilitates their development without incorporating \ntransgenic modifications. It will allow for a higher acceptance rate of GM crops in sustainable \nagriculture with rapid approval for commercialization. \nThe majority of European and Middle Eastern countries have imposed full or partial limitations \non the commercialization of GM crops. Nevertheless, because the GM crops are considered as \ngood candidates for sustainable food production, it is imperative to perform the risk assessment \nof any developed GM crop, exploring their negative and positive consequences for the current \nagricultural developments.\nBesides these techniques, genome editing tools has enabled the plant transformation with ease, \naccuracy, and specificity. Some of these methods including Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), \nTranscription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs), and Clustered Regularly Interspaced \nShort Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas system, were directed towards the concerns related to \nthe unpredictability and inefficiency of traditional transgenesis.\nThere has been a sharp increase in the approval of the number of plant species with GM \nvarieties. Around 44 countries have provided regulatory acceptance to 40 GM crops and to 509 \nevents of genetic modification since January 2022. This manipulation includes 41 commercial \ntraits for use in cultivation, food, and feed.\nThe inception of GM crops has been controversial mainly due to the ethical concerns and issues \nof sustainability surrounding the negative impacts of GM crops. \n\n \nFig. 10.

It can introduce:\na.\tAbiotic / biotic stress tolerance\nb.\tCrop yield enhancement\nc.\tQuality improvement\nd.\tNutritional enhancement\ne.\tEnhancing hybrid breeding\nGM crops faces the moral and ethical dilemma of their incorporation into the sustainable \nagricultural practices, which can be negotiated through the appropriate balance of benefits and \nnegative impacts of GM crops by encompassing all the three relational aspects of sustainability, \nsuch as the environment, society, and the economy.\nBeside the GM use in sustainable agriculture, biotechnology can contribute in many directions to \nthe development of green agriculture as it is presented in the following scheme.\n\n \nFig. 14.

            "context": "MODULE V. BIODIVERSITY\n\nI.\tEU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 (20.05.2020)\nBringing nature back into our lives\n \nEU target: key commitments by 2030\n1. Legally protect a minimum of 30% of the EU's land area and 30% of the EU's Sea area \nand integrate ecological corridors, as part of a true Trans-European Nature Network.\n2. Strictly protect at least a third of the EU's protected areas, including all remaining EU \nprimary and old-growth forests.\n3. Effectively manage all protected areas, defining clear conservation objectives and \nmeasures, and monitoring them appropriately.\n\nBiodiversity is the diversity of life on earth: of genes, species and ecosystems. In addition to \nits intrinsic value, it underpins the ecosystem services that sustain our lives in multiple \nways. They provide food, water and medicine; ensure soil and water regulation, pollination, \nerosion and flood control, disease control, and carbon storage. Biodiversity is indispensable \nfor climate change mitigation and adaptation, and for maintaining human health. It also \nenhances recreational activity, creative inspiration and cultural heritage.\nBiodiversity protection measures generally involve creating or expanding protected areas \n(PAs), clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed through legal or \nother effective means to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem \nservices and cultural values.\nRestoration is more complicated than protection. Restoration measures habitat management, \nrewilding, natural regeneration and sustainably productive lands and seas also playing an \nessential role. Modern agriculture has diminished biodiversity via intensive farming methods, \nsuch as monocultures and excessive use of chemicals. Restoration can transform degraded areas \nto landscapes providing multiple ecosystem services, balancing provisioning with regulating \nservices via sustainable land management, including shifting cultivation and crop rotation, and \ngreater incentives to farmers to adopt practices supporting biodiversity and ecosystem services. \nNature-based solutions (NBS) can play a key role. \nThe main direct drivers of biodiversity loss are changes in land and sea use, overexploitation, \nclimate change, pollution, and invasive alien species. In addition to dedicated policies to mitigate \nthese direct drivers, NBS, nature-friendly agriculture, sustainable fisheries and the restoration \npractices described above can reduce their impact. Most importantly, biodiversity needs to be \nmainstreamed across all productive and extractive sectors, such as mining, fisheries, forestry and \nagriculture.\nProtecting and restoring biodiversity and well-functioning ecosystems is therefore key to boost \nour resilience and prevent the emergence and spread of future diseases. Over half of global \nGDP depends on nature and the services it provides, with three key economic sectors - \nconstruction, agriculture, and food and drink - all highly dependent on it. Natural capital \ninvestment, including restoration of carbon-rich habitats and climate friendly agriculture, is \nrecognized to be among the five most important fiscal recovery policies, which offer high \neconomic multipliers and positive climate impact. Despite this urgent moral, economic and \nenvironmental imperative, nature is in a state of crisis. The five main direct drivers of \nbiodiversity loss - changes in land and sea use, overexploitation, climate change, pollution, and \ninvasive alien species - are making nature disappear quickly. In the last four decades, global \nwildlife populations fell by 60% as a result of human activities.\nBiodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse are one of the biggest threats facing humanity in the \nnext decade. the headline ambition to ensure that by 2050 all of the world's ecosystems are \nrestored, resilient, and adequately protected.\nThe Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 revolves around three pillars: (i) protecting and \nrestoring nature in the EU, by consolidating a coherent and effective network of PAs and \nrestoring degraded habitats; (ii) enabling a new governance framework to ensure co-\nresponsibility and co-ownership by all relevant actors in meeting the biodiversity \ncommitments, including setting up new financial opportunities; and (iii) adopting a global \nbiodiversity agenda, to strengthen the contribution of the EU towards halting global \nbiodiversity loss and minimizing externalities of EU use of resources and consumption on other \nbiodiversity-rich areas of the planet.\nIt aims to ensure that Europe's biodiversity will be on the path to recovery by 2030 for the \nbenefit of people, the planet, the climate and our economy, in line with the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development and with the objectives of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. It \naddresses the five main drivers of biodiversity loss, sets out an enhanced governance framework \nto fill remaining gaps, ensures the full implementation of EU legislation, and pulls together all \nexisting efforts. To put biodiversity on the path to recovery by 2030, we need to step up the \nprotection and restoration of nature. This should be done by improving and widening our \nnetwork of protected areas and by developing an ambitious EU Nature Restoration Plan and \nbuilding a truly coherent Trans-European Nature Network.\n\n \n\nStrengths and weaknesses of past conservation policies and practice in the European Union, as \nwell as opportunities and challenges for conservation in the coming decade (Environmental \nScience and Policy 127 (2022) 263-271, Hermoso V. et al, The EU Biodiversity Strategy for \n2030: Opportunities and challenges on the path towards biodiversity recovery)\n\nIn this spirit, at least 30% of the land and 30% of the sea should be protected in the EU. at \nleast one third of protected areas - representing 10% of EU land and 10% of EU sea - should \nbe strictly protected, at least one third of protected areas - representing 10% of EU land and \n10% of EU sea - should be strictly protected. Significant areas of other carbon-rich \necosystems, such as peatlands, grasslands, wetlands, mangroves and seagrass meadows should \nalso be strictly protected. Designations should either help to complete the Natura 2000 network \nor be under national protection schemes. In order to have a truly coherent and resilient Trans-\nEuropean Nature Network it will be important to set up ecological corridors to prevent genetic \nisolation, allow for species migration, and maintain and enhance healthy ecosystems. In this \ncontext, investments in green and blue infrastructure are important. Member States had until the \nend of 2023 to demonstrate significant progress in legally designating new protected areas and \nintegrating ecological corridors. On this basis, the Commission will assess by 2024 whether the \nEU is on track to meet its 2030 targets.\nMain objectives are:\n-Strengthening the EU legal framework for nature restoration\nTo reverse biodiversity loss, the world needs to be more ambitious on nature restoration. With a \nnew EU Nature Restoration Plan:\n*\tProposal for legally binding EU nature restoration targets to restore degraded \necosystems, in particular those with the most potential to capture and store carbon and to \nprevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters.\n*\tRequest for Member States to ensure no deterioration in conservation trends and \nstatus of all protected habitats and species by 2030.\n-Bringing nature back to agricultural land\nIt is important that farmers support and incentivize the transition to fully sustainable \npractices. To support the long-term sustainability of both nature and farming, this strategy will \nwork in tandem with the new Farm to Fork Strategy and the new Common Agricultural \nPolicy (CAP). Commission will take action to reduce by 50% the overall use of - and risk \nfrom - chemical pesticides by 2030 and reduce by 50% the use of more hazardous pesticides by \n2030. The decline of genetic diversity must also be reversed, including the use of traditional \nvarieties of crops and breeds.\n-Addressing land take and restoring soil ecosystems\nIt will be determined efforts to protect soil fertility, reduce soil erosion and increase soil \norganic matter. This should be done by adopting sustainable soil management practices.\n-Increasing the quantity of forests and improving their health and resilience.\nThe EU must increase the quantity, quality and resilience of its forests, conforming to \ndedicated EU Forest Strategy. roadmap for planting at least 3 billion additional trees in the \nEU by 2030.\n\n \n\n-Win-win solutions for energy generation\nThere will be new sustainability criteria on forest biomass to be used for energy production.\n-Restoring the good environmental status of marine ecosystems \nRestored and properly protected marine ecosystems will bring substantial health, social and \neconomic benefits to coastal communities. Marine resources must be harvested sustainably \nand there must be zero-tolerance for illegal practices. \n-Restoring freshwater ecosystems\nAt least 25,000 km of rivers will be restored into free-flowing rivers by 2030 through the \nremoval of primarily obsolete barriers and the restoration of floodplains and wetlands. \n-Greening urban and peri-urban areas\nTo bring nature back to cities and reward community action, the Commission calls on European \ncities of at least 20,000 inhabitants to develop ambitious Urban Greening Plans.\n-Reducing pollution\nBiodiversity is suffering from the release of nutrients, chemical pesticides, pharmaceuticals, \nhazardous chemicals, urban and industrial wastewater, and other waste including litter and \nplastics. All of these pressures must be reduced. That is why a new EU Chemicals Strategy for \nSustainability will be put forward along with a Zero Pollution Action Plan for Air, Water and \nSoil. This will result in the reduction of use of fertilizers by at least 20%.\n-Addressing invasive alien species\nThe implementation of the EU Invasive Alien Species Regulation; decrease the number of \nRed List species they threaten by 50%.\n \n\nMain Strategies for biodiversity conservation\n\nEU Nature Restoration Plan: key commitments by 2030:\n1. Legally binding EU nature restoration targets proposed in 2021, subject to an impact \nassessment. By 2030, significant areas of degraded and carbon-rich ecosystems are restored; \nhabitats and species show no deterioration in conservation trends and status; and at least 30% \nreach favorable conservation status or at least show a positive trend.\n2. The decline in pollinators is reversed.\n3. The risk and use of chemical pesticides is reduced by 50% and the use of more hazardous \npesticides is reduced by 50%.\n4. At least 10% of agricultural area is under high-diversity landscape features.\n5. At least 25% of agricultural land is under organic farming management, and the uptake of \nagro-ecological practices is significantly increased.\n6. Three billion new trees are planted in the EU, in full respect of ecological principles.\n7. Significant progress has been made in the remediation of contaminated soil sites.\n8. At least 25,000 km of free-flowing rivers are restored.\n9. There is a 50% reduction in the number of Red List species threatened by invasive alien \nspecies.\n10. The losses of nutrients from fertilizers are reduced by 50%, resulting in the reduction of the \nuse of fertilizers by at least 20%.\n11. Cities with at least 20,000 inhabitants have an ambitious Urban Greening Plan.\n12. No chemical pesticides are used in sensitive areas such as EU urban green areas.\n13. The negative impacts on sensitive species and habitats, including on the seabed through \nfishing and extraction activities, are substantially reduced to achieve good environmental status.\n14. The by-catch of species is eliminated or reduced to a level that allows species recovery and \nconservation.\n\n\nII.\tENABLING TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE\na.\tA new governance framework\nThe Commission will put in place a monitoring and review mechanism. This will include a clear \nset of agreed indicators and will enable regular progress assessment and set out corrective \naction if necessary.\nb.\tStepping up implementation and enforcement of EU environmental legislation\nAs regards the Birds and Habitats Directives, enforcement will focus on completing the Natura \n2000 network, the effective management of all sites, species-protection provisions, and species \nand habitats that show declining trends.\nc. Building on an integrated and whole-of-society approach\n-Business for biodiversity\nThe Commission will help to build a European Business for Biodiversity movement, taking \ninspiration from recent initiatives67 and making this movement an integral part of the European \nClimate Pact.\n-Investments, pricing and taxation\nAt least 20 billion a year should be unlocked for spending on nature. A significant \nproportion of the 25% of the EU budget dedicated to climate action will be invested on \nbiodiversity and nature-based solutions. The 'user pays' and 'polluter pays' principles have to \nbe applied to prevent and correct environmental degradation.\n-Measuring and integrating the value of nature\nIt will be done by measuring the environmental footprint of products and organizations, \nincluding through life-cycle approaches and natural capital accounting.\n-Improving knowledge, education and skills\nThe new Skills Agenda will play a key role in the transition to a green economy and the fight \nagainst biodiversity loss. The future Horizon Europe program will include a long-term strategic \nresearch agenda for biodiversity.\n\nIII.\tTHE EUROPEAN UNION FOR AN AMBITIOUS GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY AGENDA\nThe Commission proposes the EU ensures that the post-2020 global framework includes, at a \nminimum, the elements outlined below:\n*?Overarching global goals for biodiversity for 2050, in line with the United Nations 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the vision of 'living in harmony with nature'. The \nambition should be that, by 2050, all of the world's ecosystems are restored, resilient, and \nadequately protected. The world should commit to the net-gain principle to give nature back \nmore than it takes.\nThe world should commit to no human-induced extinction of species, at minimum where \navoidable.\n*\tAn enabling framework to bring the ambition to life, will be across areas such as finance, \ncapacity, research, innovation and technology.\n*?Fair and equitable sharing of the benefits from the use of genetic resources linked to \nbiodiversity.\n*?A principle of equality\n*\tInternational cooperation, neighborhood policy and resource mobilization\n\nTable 1\nSummary of action recommendations for different EU biodiversity conservation policy \ninstruments.\n\nEU policy instrument\nDevelopment needs for effective biodiversity conservation\nBiodiversity Strategy\n*\tPromote Private to Public Partnerships\n*\tPromote Payment for established provision\nMarine Strategy Framework \nDirective. \nMaritime Spatial Planning \nFramework Directive\n*\tFurther integrate biodiversity conservation into \nmaritime sectoral policies\n*\tImprove coordination among Member States for \naddressing transboundary threats to biodiversity (e.g., \nmarine litter)\n*\tImprove ecological coherence of marine protected \nareas when planning marine spatial plans\nCommon Agriculture Policy\n*\tIncorporate spatial planning in target setting and \nimplementation\n*\tPromote result-based payments\n*\tPromote funds to protect High Nature Value \nFarmland \nCommon Fisheries Policy\n*\tShift from subsidies to result-based payments\n*\tEvaluate the contribution of Fisheries Restricted \nAreas towards the achievement of biodiversity targets\n*\tPromote ecosystem-based management measures \noutside marine protected areas that have conservation \nbenefits\nEuropean Green Deal\n*\tAdequate spatial planning to minimize conflicts (e.g \nenergy production vs biodiversity)\na) European Agricultural Fund \nfor Rural Development. \nb) European Maritime and \nFisheries Fund. \nc) European Regional \nDevelopment Fund. \nd) European Maritime \nFisheries and Aquaculture \nFund\n*\tEarmark funds for conservation\n*\tDedicate funds for compensation of fishers/farmers \nand other sea and land users that contribute to threat \nmanagement\nAarhus Convention\n*\tFacilitate public participation\n\nIV.\tSOLVING CONFLICT BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND BIODIVERSITY \nCONSERVATION\nConflicts between agriculture and biodiversity conservation in Europe are increasing, due to \nmultiple demands from agricultural ecosystems, including a growing need for high quality and \ngood-value agricultural products, as well as the provision of biodiversity and ecosystem services. \nCurrents trends such as globalization, European policies, and global change, such as climate \nchange and nitrogen atmospheric deposition are potentially driving the emergence or evolution \nof biodiversity conflicts in Europe. \n\n \n\nThese trends are interwoven with continuing debates around land-sparing and land-sharing, that \noften lead to conflicting perspectives and social dynamics that influence how local actors interact \nwith each other over agriculture. Whilst some strategies have been put in place to address the \npotential competition between agriculture and biodiversity, such as reglementary and market-\nbased mechanisms, and non-monetary voluntary approaches, these need to be reflected upon and \nimproved for a future agriculture where the negative impacts of conflicts are minimized.\nAgriculture covers approximately 40% of the EU land surface area (Eurostat, 2018), producing \nbiodiverse habitats, but is also considered to be the main driver of environmental degradation, \nwith land abandonment.\nThe adoption of more intensive, mechanized, and chemically based farming production \ntechniques are further putting biodiversity under pressure. The frequent trade-off between \nproductive agriculture and farmland biodiversity has led to biodiversity conflicts.\nThe biodiversity decline continues to be insufficiently addressed in the past and current CAP and \nno sufficient structural mitigation has been provided. It seems likely that farmers will still be \nunder increased and conflicting pressure from market and conservation drivers. In relation to the \nland sharing and land sparing debate, a useful strategy for addressing biodiversity conflict and \noptimal landscapes could be a mix of those land-use strategies. \nIt will be important for conflicts between agriculture and biodiversity solving to recognize multi-\nfaceted symptoms of past and current underlying factors that go beyond specific disputes around \nbiodiversity conflict. It is also necessary that regional and local trade-offs between biodiversity \nconservation and yield improvement for the different land-use strategies are made transparent \nand are negotiated. Finally, explicit and measurable conservation targets have to be integrated \ninto local, regional and international agricultural policies to avoid biodiversity conservation \nbeing considered as a by-product of other policies, such as on sustainable intensification.\nIn addition, continued use of existing and new strategies used to address the relationship between \nbiodiversity and agriculture (reglementary, market-based, voluntary non-monetary and \nparticipative process), all highlight the importance of adopting a structured and partnership \napproach that involves researchers, managers and stakeholders, and includes monitoring, \nadaptive management, economic and social assessments, as well as the development of a conflict \nreconciliation plan at an early stage will be essential-especially as land use changes emerge \nbased on changing social structures. \nNew approaches such as agroecology, partnerships and conflict transformation all emphasize the \nneed for stronger bridges between practice, science and politics, creating a movement from \n'working with others' to 'working together' that tackles deep rooted dimensions of conflict, \nincluding power asymmetries and dynamics, with conflict seen as natural and a positive \nopportunity for transformation. In Europe, both the survival of farming and biodiversity are \nclosely interrelated, and working on common ground and shared vision will be essential for the \nfuture of agriculture. \n\n \nSolving conflict between agriculture and biodiversity conservation in Europe\n(L. Lecuyer et al., Advances in Ecological Research, Volume 65, 4-20, 2021 Elsevier Ltd)\n\nV.\tOPPORTUNITIES TO CONSERVE AND RESTORE BIODIVERSITY IN \nAGRIFOOD SYSTEMS THROUGH BIOECONOMY PRACTICES\n\nThe bioeconomy can be defined as \"the production, utilization, conservation, and regeneration of \nbiological resources, including related knowledge, science, technology, and innovation, to \nprovide sustainable solutions (information, products, processes and services) within and across \nall economic sectors and enable a transformation to a sustainable economy\" (FAO, 2021).The \nbioeconomy covers all economic sectors that rely on biological resources, from primary \nproduction (crops, livestock, forestry, fishery and aquaculture) to related processing and service \nindustries (food, feed, paper, textiles, built environment and construction, chemicals and \npharmaceuticals, energy). Circular bioeconomy closes the biological resources loop and \nmaximizes the use of residual streams from agriculture, food processing and biobased industries, \nby reusing, recycling or composting waste materials and converting them into useful products.\n\n \nA new bioeconomy model can support biodiversity\n\nBioeconomy is a knowledge-based economy, which can harness the power of biosciences and \ntechnologies across all sectors to create an innovative and sustainable economic model, which is \nenhanced by and benefits from traditional practices and knowledge. However, bioeconomy \nactivities are not necessarily sustainable per se, as the development of an economy that is based \non biological resources faces several tradeoffs. To address these trade-offs to bring about win-\nwin situations, it is essential that sustainability and circularity criteria are embedded in \nbioeconomy frameworks. \nMain objective is to ensure that development of national and regional bioeconomy policies and \nstrategies takes due account of sustainability criteria. It is to cover all three dimensions of \nsustainability (environmental, economic, social) and the governance dimension.\nBioeconomy embraces different bio-based value chains and economic activities that highly \ndepend on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Therefore, biodiversity conservation, \nprotection, sustainable use and regeneration, as well as ecosystem health, are essential \ncomponents of successful bioeconomy strategies and policies. \nThere are multiple bioeconomy practices with direct and indirect positive impacts on \nbiodiversity, addressing - often simultaneously- the five principal drivers of biodiversity loss \n(land use change, overexploitation of natural resources, pollution, invasive alien species and \nclimate change). \nBioeconomy products or practices (such as biofertilizers, biopesticides, bio-based plastics, \nbioremediation or microbiome innovations) can help to reduce soil and water pollution and \nhealth risks by decreasing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which are identified among \nmajor causes of biodiversity loss.\n A sustainable and circular bioeconomy promotes bioprocesses and circular value chains that \nallow for more sustainable production patterns that produce more with fewer resources and turn \nwaste into valuable byproducts, thereby reducing pressure on our ecosystems.\n The bioeconomy also harnesses traditional and indigenous knowledge, combined with the latest \nadvances in biosciences and innovation, including multi-omics, data and DNA sequencing, to \nenhance biodiversity knowledge and in situ and ex situ conservation. Combining tradition and \ninnovation, the bioeconomy can empower local communities with diversified income \nopportunities, while making sustainable use of biodiversity and related traditional knowledge.\n The benefits arising from the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity and related \ntraditional knowledge should be shared fairly and equitably within the bioeconomy, in particular \nlocal communities.\nThere are several ways in which bioeconomy can support biodiversity. For instance, sustainable \nbioeconomy practices related to afforestation and reforestation can reduce habitat loss and \nrestore ecosystems. Similarly, bioeconomy science and innovation are supporting developments \non how to harness the potential of microorganisms and the incredibly diverse microbial \nenvironments in which they operate (microbiomes). Microbiomes perform essential functions for \nsoils, crops, animals, forests, humans and their related ecosystems. Microbial-based strategies are \nan eco-friendly approach to restore degraded ecosystems and enhance biodiversity, while \nimproving the provision of ecosystem services.\nBioproducts, such as biopesticides, biofertilizers, bio stimulants and bio-based pest control, can \ncontribute towards reducing environmental pollution and health risks from fertilizer and \npesticide use. Improving the soil and plant microbiome is a beneficial activity for a healthier \nenvironment. Moreover, bioeconomy maximizes the use of residual streams from agriculture, \nfood processing and forest-based industries, turning them into a range of value-added products, \nthereby reducing the amount of landfilled waste and pollution, which are a serious threat for \nbiodiversity.\n\n \n\nBioscience, biotechnology, and bioinformatics innovations help in the collection, handling, \nstorage and supply of biological materials, including genetic resources, which are essential to \nenhance biodiversity knowledge and for ex situ conservation.\n\n \n\nSustainable bioeconomy practices reduce habitat loss, through the restoration of healthy \necosystems that protect and enhance biodiversity.\n(Prakash, S., Liquete, C., Biodiversity conservation.

            "context": "MODULE 6. ZERO POLLUTION\n\n\nEU target: The zero-pollution vision for 2050: a Healthy Planet for All\nAir, water and soil pollution is reduced to levels no longer considered harmful to health \nand natural ecosystems and that respect the boundaries our planet can cope with, thus \ncreating a toxic-free environment. The zero-pollution ambition is a cross-cutting objective \ncontributing to the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and complementing the \n2050 climate-neutrality goal in synergy with the clean and circular economy and restored \nbiodiversity goals.\nThe zero pollution targets for 2030:\nUnder EU law, Green Deal ambitions and in synergy with other initiatives, by 2030 the EU \nshould reduce:\n1. by more than 55% the health impacts (premature deaths) of air pollution;\n2. by 30% the share of people chronically disturbed by transport noise;\n3. by 25% the EU ecosystems where air pollution threatens biodiversity;\n4. by 50% nutrient losses, the use and risk of chemical pesticides, the use of the more \nhazardous ones, and the sale of antimicrobials for farmed animals and in aquaculture;\n5. by 50% plastic litter at sea and by 30% microplastics released into the environment;\n6. significantly total waste generation and by 50% residual municipal waste.\nThe zero pollution for 2050 strategy impacts various European directives, including:\n*\tIndustrial Emissions Directive,\n*\tWater Framework Directive and related water directives (drinking water, wastewater),\n*\tEU soil strategy,\n*\tFarm to Fork strategy,\n*\tAir quality standards\n1.\tMOTIVATION AND PLANNED ACHIEVEMENTS from: Pathway to a Healthy \nPlanet for All EU Action Plan: 'Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil' \n(12.05.2021)\nClimate change, environmental pollution1, biodiversity loss and an unsustainable use of natural \nresources pose multiple risks to human, animal and ecosystem health. To build a Healthy Planet \nfor All, the European Green Deal3 calls for the EU to better monitor, report, prevent and remedy \nair, water, soil and consumer products pollution, among other things.\nDirective 2010/75/EU, Article 3(2): 'Pollution means the direct or indirect introduction, as a \nresult of human activity, of substances, vibrations, heat or noise into air, water or land which may \nbe harmful to human health or the quality of the environment, result in damage to material \nproperty, or impair or interfere with amenities and other legitimate uses of the environment'.\nThere is an urgency to act: In the EU, every year, pollution causes 1 in 8 deaths. The fight \nagainst pollution is also a fight for fairness and equality. Pollution's most harmful impacts on \nhuman health are typically borne by the most vulnerable groups.\nPollution also threatens our biodiversity and significantly contributes to the on-going mass \nextinction of species. Together with changes in land and sea use, overexploitation of natural \nresources, climate change and invasive alien species, pollution is one of the five main drivers of \nbiodiversity loss.\nEconomic progress and pollution reduction can go together: between 2000 and 2017, the \nEU's GDP grew by 32%, while emissions of the main air pollutants decreased by 10% (ammonia, \nmainly from agriculture) to 70% (Sulfur oxides, mainly from industrial production). However, \nthe overall fivefold growth of the global economy in the past five decades has come at \nmassive cost to the global environment.\nThe economic case for acting on pollution is clear and the benefits for society far outweigh \nthe costs, just as the costs of inaction hugely outweigh the costs of action.\nAt the same time, we need a better integrated overview of pollution for public and private \nactors to tackle connected pollution issues across space and time and address their interplay with \nother environmental, social and economic considerations as effectively as possible in their \npolicy, investment and purchase decisions.\nPollution does not stop at borders. While pollution enters the EU through oceans, rivers, winds \nor imported goods, the EU also causes significant pollution elsewhere in the world through its \nown production and consumption patterns as well as its waste. At the same time the EU has \npowerful tools to contribute to pollution mitigation efforts worldwide, via its policies and funds, \nits green diplomacy, as well as by stimulating innovation, with cleaner production and more \nsustainable consumption of goods and services.\nThe main objective of this action plan is to provide a compass for including pollution \nprevention in all relevant EU policies.\n\n \nFig. 1. The zero-pollution hierarchy - reversing the pyramid of action, prioritizing the approaches for \ntackling pollution (EU Action Plan: 'Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil')\nWe must implement the existing EU regulatory frameworks protecting air, freshwaters, seas \nand oceans faster and better, while urgently working towards a framework to regularly \nassess the status of EU soils and take action at all levels to address soil pollution and \ndegradation.\nBy 2030 the number of land and freshwater ecosystems where air pollution-related \neutrophication threatens biodiversity must be reduced by 25%.\nWhen it comes to freshwater and marine pollution, achieving 'good status' under the Water \nFramework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive would bring the EU \nclose to realizing the zero pollution ambition for all aquatic ecosystems.\nThe Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive will, in synergy with the evaluation of the \nSewage Sludge Directive, help to increase the ambition level to remove nutrients from \nwastewater and make treated water and sludge ready for reuse, supporting more circular, less \npolluting farming.\nAs announced in the Farm to Fork and Biodiversity Strategies, pollution from pesticides in air, \nwater and soil should be reduced by cutting by 50% in 2030 their overall use and risk. By 2030, \n75% of soils are healthy, also thanks to a specific objective on reducing soil pollution and \nenhancing restoration.\nIn the framework of the EU soil strategy, the Commission will develop measures to \nsignificantly increase efforts to identify, investigate, assess and remediate contaminated sites, so \nthat by 2050 soil pollution will no longer pose a health or environmental risk.\nThe Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) is the main instrument regulating air, water and \nsoil pollutant emissions from over 52 000 of the largest EU industrial installations. Embracing \nthe zero-pollution ambition in production and consumption also means that chemicals, \nmaterials and products have to be as safe and sustainable as possible by design and during their \nlife cycle, leading to non-toxic material cycles.\nClearly, the zero-pollution transformation needs not only funding and technologies, but also \nskilled people to make best use of both. And this holds true not just for digital skills. The \nCommission will implement the Skills' Agenda, amongst others by supporting the development \nof a core green skills set for the labor market to guide training across the economy with a view \nto creating a generation of climate, environment, and health conscious professionals and green \neconomic operators. \nTo help ensure that the green transition and sustainability become part of the education \ncurriculum, in 2021 the Commission proposes a Council Recommendation on education for \nenvironmental sustainability and a European Competence Framework for Climate Change \nand Sustainable Development.\nThe EU will also aim to ensure that pollution is effectively tackled as part of an ambitious post- \n2020 global framework on biodiversity at the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention \non Biological Diversity.\nThe Commission will encourage partner countries to improve their policy and regulatory \nframeworks and put in place the right incentives to reduce pollution, notably through the use of \ngreen budgeting and environmental taxes. Furthermore, the upcoming initiative on sustainable \ncorporate governance will introduce due diligence duties across economic value chains, \nincluding environmental impacts related to business operations.\nThe Commission will promote global zero pollution in all relevant international fora and work \nwith the EU Member States and stakeholders to significantly reduce the EU's external pollution \nfootprint.\nTo integrate the monitoring of different types of pollution and assess their health, environmental, \neconomic and social impacts, the Commission, in partnership with relevant EU agencies, will \ndevelop an integrated Zero Pollution Monitoring and Outlook Framework, as part of the \nwider 8th Environment Action Program (EAP) monitoring.\n\n2.\tAIR POLLUTION CONTROL\nAir pollution control, represents the techniques employed to reduce or eliminate the emission \ninto the atmosphere of substances that can harm the environment or human health. The control of \nair pollution is one of the principal areas of pollution control, along with wastewater treatment, \nsolid-waste management, and hazardous-waste management.\nAir is considered to be polluted when it contains certain substances in concentrations high \nenough and for durations long enough to cause harm or undesirable effects. These include \nadverse effects on human health, property, and atmospheric visibility. The atmosphere is \nsusceptible to pollution from natural sources as well as from human activities. Some natural \nphenomena, such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires, may have not only local and regional \neffects, but also long-lasting global ones. Nevertheless, only pollution caused by human \nactivities, such as industry and transportation, is subject to mitigation and control.\nMost air contaminants originate from combustion processes.\nThe criteria pollutants include fine particulates, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen \ndioxide, ozone, and lead. Since the end of the 20th century, there also has been a recognition of \nthe hazardous effects of trace amounts of many other air pollutants called \"air toxics.\" Most air \ntoxics are organic chemicals, comprising molecules that contain carbon, hydrogen, and other \natoms. Specific emission regulations have been implemented against those pollutants. In \naddition, the long-term and far-reaching effects of the \"greenhouse gases\" on atmospheric \nchemistry and climate have been observed, and cooperative international efforts have been \nundertaken to control those pollutants. The greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, \nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone.\nI.\tMobile substances\nThe Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability recognizes the need to address pollution from so-\ncalled persistent and mobile substances. Mobile substances are defined as those that travel long \ndistances with water, including groundwater, and can thus spread over large spatial and temporal \nscales. Examples of persistent and mobile substances that are attracting attention at the time of \nwriting include melamine, benzotriazole, 1,4-dioxane and many per and polyfluoroalkyl \nsubstances (PFAS). A holistic approach is needed, whereby substances currently used in \ncommerce are prioritized and strategies are then identified to prevent unnecessary exposure to \nthese substances. A holistic approach includes not only an assessment of exposure, hazard and \nrisk, but also requires reflection regarding product use scenarios, differentiating between \n'essential-use' and non-essential use. Barriers represented by a lack of knowledge, time and \nmoney can result in poorly informed decisions which may present themselves as regrettable \nsubstitutions. A more holistic science-based evaluation, considering the whole life cycle of the \npersistent and mobile substance, can help improve substitution decisions by providing \nquantitative information regarding the relative impact of a chemical ingredient throughout \nmanufacture, use and disposal.\nThe need to prioritize persistent and mobile substances for prevention and removal, before \nexposure is too wide spread, or before risks are too great, is clear. Costs related to identification, \nscreening and remediation of sites contaminated with PFAS across Europe is around 10-20 \nbillion per annum, rising to 52-84 billion per annum, when costs such as increased healthcare \ndemands, ecological damage, property loss and impacts on the agricultural sector are included. \nRemoval of persistent and mobile substances from already polluted sites is difficult.\nGiven that these costs represent only a partial removal and that the methods are resource \nintensive, there is an urgent need to identify sustainable treatment technologies able to remove \npersistent and mobile substances. In the Program Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation, Action \nproject called \"Zero PM: Zero pollution of persistent, mobile substances\", will interlink and \nsynergize three strategies to protect the environment and human health from persistent, mobile \nsubstances: Prevent, Prioritize and Remove. To prevent pollution of persistent and mobile \nsubstances, Zero PM will activate the momentum of the EU's Chemicals Strategy to support its \nimplementation through the development of scientific, policy and market tools for the \nsubstitution and mitigation of prioritized, non-essential persistent and mobile substances to safer \nand sustainable alternatives.\nII.\tControl of particulates\nThe best way to protect air quality is to reduce the emission of pollutants by changing to cleaner \nfuels and processes. Pollutants not eliminated in this way must be collected or trapped by \nappropriate air-cleaning devices as they are generated and before they can escape into the \natmosphere. These devices are described below and designed to remove particulate and gaseous \npollutants from the emissions of stationary sources, including power plants and industrial \nfacilities.\nAirborne particles can be removed from a polluted airstream by a variety of physical processes. \nCommon types of equipment for collecting fine particulates include cyclones, scrubbers, \nelectrostatic precipitators, and baghouse filters. Once collected, particulates adhere to each other, \nforming agglomerates that can readily be removed from the equipment and disposed of, usually \nin a landfill.\nBecause each air pollution control project is unique, it is usually not possible to decide in \nadvance what the best type of particle-collection device (or combination of devices) will be; \ncontrol systems must be designed on a case-by-case basis. Important particulate characteristics \nthat influence the selection of collection devices include corrosivity, reactivity, shape, density, \nand especially size and size distribution (the range of different particle sizes in the airstream). \nOther design factors include airstream characteristics (e.g., pressure, temperature, and viscosity), \nflow rate, removal efficiency requirements, and allowable resistance to airflow. \nA) Cyclone separator (Fig. 2)\nIn general, cyclone collectors are often used to control industrial dust emissions and as pre-\ncleaners for other kinds of collection devices. A cyclone removes particulates by causing the \ndirty airstream to flow in a spiral path inside a cylindrical chamber. Dirty air enters the chamber \nfrom a tangential direction at the outer wall of the device, forming a vortex as it swirls within the \nchamber. The larger particulates, because of their greater inertia, move outward and are forced \nagainst the chamber wall. Slowed by friction with the wall surface, they then slide down the wall \ninto a conical dust hopper at the bottom of the cyclone. The cleaned air swirls upward in a \nnarrower spiral through an inner cylinder and emerges from an outlet at the top. Accumulated \nparticulate dust is periodically removed from the hopper for disposal.\nCyclones are best at removing relatively coarse particulates. They can routinely achieve \nefficiencies of 90 percent for particles larger than about 20 micrometers (µm). By themselves, \nhowever, cyclones are not sufficient to meet stringent air quality standards. They are typically \nused as pre-cleaners and are followed by more efficient air-cleaning equipment such as \nelectrostatic precipitators and baghouses.\n \nB)\tWet scrubber (Fig. 3)\nA Wet Scrubber is an emission control device that abates particulate (PM) or gases using \na scrubbing liquid. The type of scrubbing liquid used is dependent on the target \ncontaminants that need treatment. The dirty exhaust stream is introduced into the scrubber \nvessel and interacts with the scrubbing liquid. Wet scrubbers are usually applied in the \ncontrol of flammable or explosive dusts or mists from such sources as industrial and \nchemical processing facilities and hazardous-waste incinerators; they can handle hot \nairstreams and sticky particles.\n\n \nC)\tElectrostatic precipitator (Fig. 4)\n \nElectrostatic precipitator is a common particle-collection device at fossil-fuel power-generating \nstations. Electrostatic precipitation is a commonly used method for removing fine particulates \nfrom airstreams. In an electrostatic precipitator, particles suspended in the airstream are given an \nelectric charge as they enter the unit and are then removed by the influence of an electric field. \nThe precipitation unit comprises baffles for distributing airflow, discharge and collection \nelectrodes, a dust clean-out system, and collection hoppers. A high voltage of direct current \n(DC), as much as 100,000 volts, is applied to the discharge electrodes to charge the particles, \nwhich then are attracted to oppositely charged collection electrodes, on which they become \ntrapped.\nAn electrostatic precipitator can remove particulates as small as 1 µm with an efficiency \nexceeding 99 percent. The effectiveness of electrostatic precipitators in removing fly ash from \nthe combustion gases of fossil-fuel furnaces accounts for their high frequency of use at power \nstations.\nD)\tBaghouse filters (Fig. 5)\n \nBaghouse is employing an array of fabric bags for filtering the airstream.\nOne of the most efficient devices for removing suspended particulates is an assembly of fabric-\nfilter bags, commonly called a baghouse. A typical baghouse comprises an array of long, narrow \nbags-each about 25 cm in diameter-that are suspended upside down in a large enclosure. \nDust-laden air is blown upward through the bottom of the enclosure by fans. Particulates are \ntrapped inside the filter bags, while the clean air passes through the fabric and exits at the top of \nthe baghouse.\nA fabric-filter dust collector can remove very nearly 100 percent of particles as small as 1 µm \nand a significant fraction of particles as small as 0.01 µm. Fabric filters, however, offer relatively \nhigh resistance to airflow, which leads to substantial energy usage for the fan system. In addition, \nin order to prolong the useful life of the filter fabric, the air to be cleaned must be cooled.\nIII.\tControl of gases\nGaseous pollutants, as well as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other gaseous air toxics, \nare controlled by means of three basic techniques: absorption, adsorption, and incineration (or \ncombustion). These techniques can be employed singly or in combination. They are effective \nagainst the major greenhouse gases as well. In addition, a fourth technique, known as carbon \nsequestration, is in development as a means of controlling carbon dioxide levels.\n*\tAbsorption In the context of air pollution control, absorption involves the transfer of a \ngaseous pollutant from the air into a contacting liquid, such as water. The liquid must be able \neither to serve as a solvent for the pollutant or to capture it by means of a chemical reaction.\n*\tWet scrubbers and packed scrubbers\nWet scrubbers similar to those described above for controlling suspended particulates may be \nused for gas absorption. Gas absorption can also be carried out in packed scrubbers, or towers, in \nwhich the liquid is present on a wetted surface rather than as droplets suspended in the air. A \ncommon type of packed scrubber is the countercurrent tower. After entering the bottom of the \ntower, the polluted airstream flows upward through a wetted column of light, chemically inactive \npacking material. The liquid absorbent flows downward and is uniformly spread throughout the \ncolumn packing, thereby increasing the total area of contact between gas and liquid. \nThermoplastic materials are most widely used as packing for countercurrent scrubber towers. \nThese devices usually have gas-removal efficiencies of 90-95 percent.\nCocurrent and cross-flow packed scrubber designs are also used for gas absorption. In the \ncocurrent design, both gas and liquid flow in the same direction-vertically downward through \nthe scrubber. Although not as efficient as countercurrent designs, cocurrent devices can work at \nhigher liquid flow rates. The increased flow prevents plugging of the packing, when the \nairstream contains high levels of particulates. Cocurrent designs afford lowered resistance to \nairflow and allow the cross-sectional area of the tower to be reduced. \nIn general, scrubbers are used at fertilizer production facilities (to remove ammonia from the \nairstream), at glass production plants (to remove hydrogen fluoride), at chemical plants (to \nremove water-soluble solvents such as acetone and methyl alcohol), and at rendering plants (to \ncontrol odors).\n*\tFlue gas desulfurization (FGD) (Fig. 6)\nSulfur dioxide in flue gas from fossil-fuel power plants can be controlled by means of an \nabsorption process called flue gas desulfurization (FGD). FGD systems may involve wet \nscrubbing or dry scrubbing. In wet FGD systems, flue gases are brought in contact with an \nabsorbent, which can be either a liquid or a slurry of solid material. The sulfur dioxide dissolves \nin or reacts with the absorbent and becomes trapped in it. In dry FGD systems, the absorbent is \ndry pulverized lime or limestone; once absorption occurs, the solid particles are removed by \nmeans of baghouse filters (described above). Dry FGD systems, compared with wet systems, \noffer cost and energy savings and easier operation, but they require higher chemical consumption \nand are limited to flue gases derived from the combustion of low-sulfur coal.\nFGD systems are also classified as either regenerable or non-regenerable (throwaway), \ndepending on whether the sulfur that is removed from the flue gas is recovered or discarded. \nNon-regenerable FGD systems produce a sulfur-containing sludge residue that requires \nappropriate disposal. Regenerable FGD systems require additional steps to convert the sulfur \ndioxide into useful by-products like sulfuric acid.\n\n \nFig. 6. Wet scrubber using a limestone slurry to remove sulfur dioxide from flue gas.\nSeveral FGD methods exist, differing mainly in the chemicals used in the process. FGD \nprocesses that employ either lime or limestone slurries as the reactants are widely applied. In the \nlimestone scrubbing process, sulfur dioxide reacts with limestone (calcium carbonate) particles \nin the slurry, forming calcium sulfite and carbon dioxide. In the lime scrubbing process, sulfur \ndioxide reacts with slaked lime (calcium hydroxide), forming calcium sulfite and water. \nDepending on sulfur dioxide concentrations and oxidation conditions, the calcium sulfite can \ncontinue to react with water, forming calcium sulfate (gypsum). Neither calcium sulfite nor \ncalcium sulfate is very soluble in water, and both can be precipitated out as a slurry by gravity \nsettling. The thick slurry, called FGD sludge, creates a significant disposal problem. Flue gas \ndesulfurization helps to reduce ambient sulfur dioxide levels and mitigate the problem of acid \nrain. \n*\tAdsorption\nGas adsorption, as contrasted with absorption, is a surface phenomenon. The gas molecules are \nsorbed-attracted to and held-on the surface of a solid. Gas adsorption methods are used for \nodor control at various types of chemical-manufacturing and food-processing facilities, in the \nrecovery of a number of volatile solvents (e.g., benzene), and in the control of VOCs at industrial \nfacilities.\nActivated carbon (heated charcoal) is one of the most common adsorbent materials. It is very \nporous and has an extremely high ratio of surface area to volume. Activated carbon is \nparticularly useful as an adsorbent for cleaning airstreams that contain VOCs and for solvent \nrecovery and odor control. A properly designed carbon adsorption unit can remove gas with an \nefficiency exceeding 95 percent. Adsorption systems are configured either as stationary bed units \nor as moving bed units. \n*\tIncineration\nThe process called incineration or combustion-chemically, rapid oxidation-can be used to \nconvert VOCs and other gaseous hydrocarbon pollutants to carbon dioxide and water. \nIncineration of VOCs and hydrocarbon fumes usually is accomplished in a special incinerator \ncalled an afterburner. To achieve complete combustion, the afterburner must provide the proper \namount of turbulence and burning time, and it must maintain a sufficiently high temperature. \nSufficient turbulence, or mixing, is a key factor in combustion, because it reduces the required \nburning time and temperature. A process called direct flame incineration can be used when the \nwaste gas is itself a combustible mixture and does not need the addition of air or fuel.\nAn afterburner typically is made of a steel shell lined with refractory material such as firebrick. \nThe refractory lining protects the shell and serves as a thermal insulator. Given enough time and \nhigh enough temperatures, gaseous organic pollutants can be almost completely oxidized, with \nincineration efficiency approaching 100 percent. Certain substances, such as platinum, can act in \na manner that assists the combustion reaction. These substances, called catalysts, allow complete \noxidation of the combustible gases at relatively low temperatures.\nAfterburners are used to control odors, destroy toxic compounds, or reduce the amount of \nphotochemically reactive substances released into the air. They are employed at a variety of \nindustrial facilities, where VOC vapors are emitted from combustion processes or solvent \nevaporation (e.g., petroleum refineries, paint-drying facilities, and paper mills).\n*\tCarbon sequestration\nThe best way to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide in the air is to use energy more efficiently \nand to reduce the combustion of fossil fuels by using alternative energy sources (e.g., nuclear, \nwind, tidal, and solar power). In addition, carbon sequestration can be used to serve the purpose. \nCarbon sequestration involves the long-term storage of carbon dioxide underground, as well as \non the surface of Earth in forests and oceans. Carbon sequestration in forests and oceans relies on \nnatural processes such as forest growth. However, the clearing of forests for agricultural and \nother purposes (and also the pollution of oceans) diminishes natural carbon sequestration. \nStoring carbon dioxide underground-a technology under development that is also called geo \nsequestration or carbon capture and storage-would involve pumping the gas directly into \nunderground geologic \"reservoir\" layers. This would require the separation of carbon dioxide \nfrom power plant flue gases (or some other source)-a costly process.\n\n3.\tWATER POLLUTION\nWater pollution represents the release of substances into subsurface groundwater or into lakes, \nstreams, rivers, estuaries, and oceans to the point, where the substances interfere with beneficial \nuse of the water or with the natural functioning of ecosystems. In addition to the release of \nsubstances, such as chemicals, trash, or microorganisms, water pollution may also include the \nrelease of energy, in the form of radioactivity or heat, into bodies of water.\nWhen water becomes contaminated, it has detrimental effects on both animals and plants (who \nrely on uncontaminated water), and the sensitive water environment. \nWater pollution can come from any of the followings:\n*\tUrban development \nThe process by which a lake changes from a clean, clear condition-with a relatively low \nconcentration of dissolved nutrients and a balanced aquatic community-to a nutrient-rich, \nalgae-filled state and thence to an oxygen-deficient, waste-filled condition is called \neutrophication. Eutrophication is a naturally occurring, slow, and inevitable process. However, \nwhen it is accelerated by human activity and water pollution (a phenomenon called cultural \neutrophication), it can lead to the premature aging and death of a body of water.\nThe improper disposal of solid waste is a major source of water pollution. Solid waste includes \ngarbage, rubbish, electronic waste, trash, and construction and demolition waste, all of which are \ngenerated by individual, residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial activities.\n*\tSewage & wastewater\nDomestic sewage is the primary source of pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms) and \nputrescible organic substances. Because pathogens are excreted in feces, all sewage from cities \nand towns is likely to contain pathogens of some type, potentially presenting a direct threat to \npublic health. Putrescible organic matter presents a different sort of threat to water quality. As \norganics are decomposed naturally in the sewage by bacteria and other microorganisms, the \ndissolved oxygen content of the water is depleted. This endangers the quality of lakes and \nstreams, where high levels of oxygen are required for fish and other aquatic organisms to \nsurvive. Sewage-treatment processes reduce the levels of pathogens and organics in wastewater, \nbut they do not eliminate them completely.\n*\tMining\n*\tMarine dumping\n*\tOil leakages\n*\tBurning fossil fuels\n*\tAgriculture: Chemical fertilizers & pesticides\n*\tSewer leakages\n*\tGlobal warming\n*\tRadioactive waste\n*\tAnimal waste\n*\tAcid rain\nThere is no single or simple answer to stop the water pollution crisis, however, there are many \nsolutions to prevent water pollution both in our daily lives and within industries. \nWe can separate the issue with water pollution into 10 notable solutions:\n*\tWastewater Treatment\n*\tReducing Plastic Waste \n*\tWater Conservation\n*\tWater-efficient Toilets \n*\tSeptic Tanks\n*\tDo Not Use the Toilet as a Trash Bin\n*\tStormwater Management\n*\tGreen Agriculture & Wetlands\n*\tDenitrification\n*\tOzone Wastewater Treatment\nWastewater Treatment\nTreating water before it enters the waterway system is probably the most efficient way of \nreducing water pollution - hitting the issue right at the source! \nWastewater treatment facilities have the technology and tools to remove most pollutants through \nbiological, physical, and chemical processes. For example, sewage treatments allow water to \ntravel through different sanitization chambers to reduce toxic levels of water pollutants and \nprevent leakages into water systems. \nTo ensure that wastewater treatments function properly, regular maintenance of equipment is \nrequired. This includes applications such as water treatment sensors, which are vital to measure \nand remove contaminants to reduce water pollution. \nReducing Plastic Waste\nPlastic waste is a huge issue. More than 8 tons of plastic enters our ocean every year, plus the \nplastic is to outweigh the number of fish by 2050, these facts are shocking! Plastic waste also \ndecays water supplies. This is why it is extremely important to reduce plastic waste and improve \nsustainability both locally and globally. \nPlastic bottles and bags get most of the media coverage, but plastics are entering water systems \nin ways you cannot always see, and are most likely not aware of. \nMicroplastics are a major issue and are found in:\n*\tIndustrial manufacturing\n*\tSynthetic textiles \n*\tClothing\n*\tPersonal care products (toothpaste, shampoo, etc.)\nTo reduce plastic waste at home, we can do the followings:\n*\tRecycle plastics\n*\tUse alternatives to plastic like reusable utensils, grocery bags, etc.\n*\tShop locally and buy fruit & vegetables not wrapped in plastic\n*\tBuy organic/natural & environmentally-friendly care products \nWater Conservation\nWater is a scarce resource, so limiting the amount of water you use daily will contribute to \nreducing water pollution. \nSeptic Tanks\nSeptic tanks are a great way to efficiently treat sewage; separating solids from liquid. Septic \ntanks degrade solids and allow liquid to flow into drainage systems via biological processes. \nUsing septic tanks reduces water pollution by removing pollutants already present in water. \nStormwater Management\nTreatment and management of stormwater vary from reverse osmosis (RO), advanced oxidation, \nand sand filtration. \nGreen Agriculture & Wetlands\nAgriculture is a huge industry worldwide, using up to 70% of surface water supplies to meet the \ndemand of livestock production and farming. \nAs agriculture is such a large industry, it is one of the primary causes of water pollution. When it \nrains, runoff transports pesticides and fertilizers. \nAgriculture can be environmentally friendly, known as green agriculture. Green agriculture \ninvolves using pesticides and fertilizers that contain no harmful chemicals. It also includes \nplanting trees and creating wetlands to form buffer zones, which filter runoff and water \npollutants.\nDenitrification\nWhen nitrate levels are high in water, it creates the perfect environment for eutrophication or \noverfertilization from runoff to occur. This allows algae and phytoplankton in the water to \nrapidly grow, reducing water quality, and contributing to the water pollution issue.  \nDenitrification is directly converting nitrates into nitrogen gas. This ecological process prevents \nnitrate leaching into soils and helps reduce groundwater contamination.\nOzone Wastewater Treatment\nAlthough this is also a wastewater treatment, it goes through a different process to regular \nwastewater systems, which is why it is important to also note. \nOzone wastewater treatment uses an ozone generator to break down water pollutants. Ultraviolet \n(UV) radiation or an electric discharge field inside the generator converts oxygen into ozone. \nThis process oxidizes bacteria, organic matter, and other water pollutants. \nThere are 7 ways we can test water quality and reduce water pollution:\n*\tCDOM (colored dissolved organic matter)/FDOM (fluorescent dissolved organic matter) \nMonitoring\n*\tChlorophyll Fluorescence Analysis\n*\tConductivity, Salinity & TDS (total dissolved solids) Monitoring \n*\tMeasuring Water Temperature\n*\tMeasuring DO\n*\tpH Testing\n*\tEvaluating Turbidity & TSS (Total Suspended Solids)\n\n4.\tSOIL POLLUTION MANAGEMENT\nSoil, also commonly referred to as earth or dirt, is a mixture of organic matter, minerals, gases, \nliquids, and organisms that together support the life of plants and soil organisms. Soil consists of \na solid phase of minerals and organic matter (the soil matrix), as well as a porous phase that \nholds gases (the soil atmosphere) and water (the soil solution). Accordingly, soil is a three-state \nsystem of solids, liquids, and gases.\nSoil pollution refers to the presence of a chemical or substance out of place and/or present in \na soil at higher-than-normal concentration that has adverse effects on any non-targeted \norganism. Soil contamination, soil pollution, or land pollution as a part of land degradation is \ncaused by the presence of xenobiotic (human-made) chemicals or other alteration in the natural \nsoil environment.\n \nFig. 7. Sources of soil pollutants\nSoil pollution can be caused by the following (non-exhaustive list): \n*\tMicroplastics\n*\tOil spills\n*\tMining and activities by other heavy industries\n*\tAccidental spills may happen during activities, etc.\n*\tCorrosion of underground storage tanks (including piping used to transmit the contents)\n*\tAcid rain\n*\tIntensive farming\n*\tAgrochemicals, such as pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers\n*\tPetrochemicals\n*\tIndustrial accidents\n*\tRoad debris\n*\tConstruction activities\n*\tExterior lead-based paints\n*\tDrainage of contaminated surface water into the soil\n*\tAmmunitions, chemical agents, and other agents of war\n*\tWaste disposal \n*\tOil and fuel dumping\n*\tNuclear wastes\n*\tDirect discharge of industrial wastes to the soil\n*\tDischarge of sewage\n*\tLandfill and illegal dumping\n*\tCoal ash\n*\tElectronic waste\n*\tContaminated by rocks containing large amounts of toxic elements.\n*\tContaminated by Pb due to vehicle exhaust, Cd, and Zn caused by tire wear.\n*\tContamination by strengthening air pollutants by incineration of fossil raw materials.\nImpacts of soil pollution are not confined to soil and its biota but are carried over to every aspect \nof the environment and affect every organism from the earthworm to humans: Human health, \nGrowth of plants, Air pollution, Diminished Soil Fertility, Impact on scene and Odor \ncontamination, Changes in Soil Structure, Impact on Ecosystem and Biodiversity, Tainting \nof Water Sources.\nSoil remediation involves the elimination of contaminants from the soil through a range of \nchemical, physical and biological means that can be applied to carry it out.\nIn situ and ex situ soil remediation technologies can be classified as physical, biological, \nchemical, and combined approaches. Whereas in situ soil remediation technologies are aimed at \nthe decontamination of soil at its original site, ex situ technologies are performed through the \nexcavation of the soil and decontaminating it away from its original site. In situ remediation \ntechnologies can involve chemical or biological processes. Chemical remediation technologies \nuse chemical reagents, and the mechanisms involved include ion exchange, catalysis, adsorption, \noxidation, and reduction. In this respect, activated carbons have been widely used due to their \ncapability to eliminate a wide range of organic and inorganic contaminants.\nIn situ soil remediation technologies can be a favorable strategy for large scale of contaminated \nsoil as it offers less disturbance to the ecosystem and is less cost effective. These technologies \ninvolve the supply and retrieval of fluids and reactants to the soil subsurface. Their effectiveness \ndepends on soil conditions and contaminant characteristics. For instance, chemical oxidation and \nbioventing are affected by soil permeability, whereas conductive heating is not. In situ \nbioremediation on the one hand, supplements nutrients to the contaminated soil to stimulate soil \nmicroorganisms to degrade pollutants. Alternatively, new microorganisms are introduced into the \nsoil or native microorganisms are enhanced through genetic engineering to target specific \npollution. However, the use of natural microorganisms can be affected by inadequate nutrient \nsupply and/or the nature of contaminated sites. In situ bioremediation techniques include bio-\nabsorption, composting, bio-ventilation, natural attenuation, bio-purification, and microbial-\nassisted phytoremediation. Physical soil remediation technologies aim at stopping or reversing \nenvironmental damage through the use of physical strategies such as flushing, capping, thermal \ntreatment. For soil contaminated with SVOCs) (Semi-volatile organic compounds), thermal \ntreatment can be a suitable method. In situ capping is achieved by placing a clean isolation \nmaterial cover over the contaminated soil. Flushing using a mixture of water and surfactants can \nbe a more suitable and effective method of in situ remediation for soils contaminated with \nhydrophobic organic pollutants.\nEx situ technologies include the use of bio piles and slurry phase biological treatment amongst \nothers. In bio piles, petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soils are excavated and placed in bio \npiles, where they are mixed with agents that promoted the degradation process at the treatment \nsite. The effectiveness of the process can be improved by controlling aeration, moisture, \ntemperature, oxygen and pH. Slurry phase biological treatment is performed in a reactor \ncontaining a mixture of the excavated soil and water, and nutrients are added to promote \nmicroorganism growth and activity that subsequently leads to the biodegradation of organic \ncompounds.\n \nFig. 8. Soil remediation technologies\nMany benefits of biochar practice for soil remediation have been reported, such as increased \ncarbon sequestration trends, soil fertility, biomass production, crop yield, and minimize emission \nof greenhouse gases. Biochar, also renowned as biomass-derived black carbon, is becoming a \nvaluable amendment for sustainable agriculture. It is a recalcitrant carbonaceous material \nderived from bio-waste matter combusted under anaerobic conditions, which is an economical \nand eco-friendly method of carbon sequestration. Soil physiological properties have been \naffected by using biochar with various characteristics and application rates for soil amendments. \nBiochar can improve physicochemical and biological properties of cultivated soils.\nPhytoremediation\nA novel approach to soil remediation is phytoremediation, i.e., remediation by plants. One type \nof phytoremediation is phytoextraction, in which plants are used to take up contaminants and the \nplants are then harvested and treated or disposed of. In this process, most often proposed for \nheavy metals and certain other inorganic contaminants such as arsenic, a soil is planted with a \nspecies that has a high affinity for the contaminant. Such plants, called hyperaccumulators, \nmobilize metals from the soil and store them in plant tissue. In many cases, these plants can \ntransport the metals via their vascular tissue to aboveground parts, such as stems and leaves, \nwhich can be periodically harvested and disposed of in a secure manner. In some cases, it is \npractical to recover the metal(s) from the plant material. By this process, the metal contaminant \nis gradually removed from the soil, often at a lower cost than by alternative means. \nPhytoremediation has also been proposed for some organic contaminants; for example, carbon \ntetrachloride (CCl4) has been shown to be taken up from soil porewater and dechlorinated by \npoplar trees.\n \nFig. 9.
