# BEC-MM-ChatBot

To run the application, run the ChatbotAPP.exe in the main folder.
It might throw a "Windows protected your PC" warning, it is fine, just run it.
When starting the app, a terminal and then the application will start automatically within a few seconds.
It might take a bit before the app is properly initialized and it starts working well.

Thank you for using our app!



# IF DOWNLOADING/CLONING FROM GITHUB

Assuming git is already installed:
Git LFS will be needed (Git for large files - over 100mb).
Download & Install it from the official release page: https://git-lfs.github.com/

After the setup is done, open command prompt/powershell and run:
git lfs install

After it is installed, clone into the directory of your choice using:
git clone https://github.com/costingrasu/BEC-MM-ChatBot.git

Might be needed but not neccesary: 
After moving into the BEC-MM-Chatbot folder (with 'cd BEC-MM-ChatBot' for example) you might need to also run: 
git lfs pull

Thats it, it should work.
